# Introduction

The aim of this book is to answer the following questions:

- Why do historians claim the destruction of Jerusalem took place in 587/586 BC?
- Why is there an uncertainty between 587 and 586 BC?
- Why do Jehovah's Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem actually took place in 607 BC?
