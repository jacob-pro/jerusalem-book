# Introduction

The aim of this book is to answer the following questions:

1. Why do historians claim the destruction of Jerusalem took place in 587/586 BC?
2. Why is there an uncertainty between 587 and 586 BC?
3. Why do Jehovah's Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem actually took place in 607 BC?
 
## About the Author

My name is Jacob Halsey, I am a software engineer / computer scientist. My interest in this topic stems from
being encouraged by friends and family to research the Biblical prophecies of Daniel, and from having read the 
"Daniel Book" [@watch2006pay] many years ago. I am not (and have never been) a baptised member of 
Jehovah's Witnesses myself.
