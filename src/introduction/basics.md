The Babylonian calendar was made up of 12 lunar months. The year starts at Nisanu in the Spring; 
within about 30 days of the vernal equinox [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131]. 
However 12 lunar months are about 11 days short of a year, so in order to prevent the
months from drifting through the seasons, an intercalary 13th month, either a
second Ululu (VI₂) or a second Addaru (XII₂), was occasionally inserted by decree of the King. 
Prior to approx. 475 BC this was done at irregular
intervals, a list of known intercalary months is contained in [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 4].

The Babylonian day began at sunset. Each month starts "when the thin crescent of the new moon was first visible in the
sky at sunset" [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 1]. The moon becomes visible between about 15 to 48 hours after conjunction 
(at Mediterranean latitudes), although first sighting may also be delayed by weather conditions, but
not by more than one day [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131].
