# Significance to Jehovah's Witnesses

The date of the destruction of Jerusalem is used as the foundation of a very important belief to Jehovah’s Witnesses —
the 'end of the Gentile Times'.

The 'Gentile times' is an interpretation of a prophecy found in Luke 21:24 combined with Daniel chapter 4. These times
are believed to be 2520 years long, starting from the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BC and ending in 1914 AD
[@watch2014what, 215].

According to the Watchtower 1986 [@watch1986questions]:

> Approved association with Jehovah’s Witnesses requires accepting the entire range of the true teachings of the Bible,
> including those Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. What do such beliefs include? ... That 1914
> marked the end of the Gentile Times and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as well as the time
> for Christ’s foretold presence.

In addition, the 'end of the Gentile Times' in 1914 is also used as a foundation for a number of other interpretations
of prophesy in the 'Time of the End' [@watch2006pay, 286]:

Daniel 12:7: 'a time, times and half a time' is interpreted as a period of 1260 days running from December 1914 (release
of 1915 year text) to 21 June 1918 (the sentencing of J.F. Rutherford and other directors of the Watch Tower Society)
[@watch1993daniel, 9].

Daniel 12:11: '1290 days' is counted from the January 1919 (the proposal of the League of Nations) until September 1922
(Bible student convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A).

Daniel 12:12: 'the 1,335 days' is counted from September 1922 (see above) until May 1926 (adoption of 'A Testimony to
the Rulers of the World', at the London convention).
