# Significance to Jehovah's Witnesses

The date of the destruction of Jerusalem is used as the foundation of a very important belief to Jehovah’s Witnesses 
- the '_end of the Gentile Times_'. 

The '_Gentile times_' is an interpretation of a prophesy found in Luke 21:24 combined 
with Daniel chapter 4. These times are believed to be 2520 years long, starting from the destruction of Jerusalem in 607
BC and ending in 1914 AD [@watch2014what, 215].

According to the Watchtower 1986 [@watch1986questions]:

> Approved association with Jehovah’s Witnesses requires accepting the entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, 
> including those Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. What do such beliefs include? ...
> That 1914 marked the end of the Gentile Times and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as well as 
> the time for Christ’s foretold presence. 

In addition the '_end of the Gentile Times_' in 1914 is also used as a foundation for a number of
other interpretations of prophesy in the '_Time of the End_' [@watch2006pay, 286]:

Daniel 12:7: '_a time, times and half a time_' is interpreted as a period of 1260 days running from December 1914 
(release of 1915 year text) to 21 June 1918 (the sentencing of J F Rutherford and other directors of the Watch Tower 
Society) [@watch1993daniel, 9].

Daniel 12:11: '_1290 days_' is counted from the January 1919 (the proposal of the League of Nations) until September
1922 (Bible student convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A).

Daniel 12:12: '_the 1,335 days_' is counted from September 1922 (see above) until May 1926 (adoption of '_A Testimony to 
the Rulers of the World_', at the London convention).
