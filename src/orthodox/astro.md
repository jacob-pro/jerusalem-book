# Astronomical Texts

There are a number of texts that describe various astronomical events, such as positions of the moon, stars, planets,
lunar eclipses etc, which allow us to date the reigns of the Babylonian Kings.

This is in itself a very complicated topic and as such I have created a separate project to analyse them: 
[Astro Tablets](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets).

## Summary

[BM 32312 (ADT I Diary No. -651)](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm32312.md) contains planetary
observations from the 16th year of Shamash-shum-ukin dated to -651.

[BM 41222 (ADT V Planetary Text No. 52)](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm41222.md) contains planetary
observations from the reigns of many different kings, and matches the 14th year of Shamash-shum-ukin to -653, 
1st year of Kandalanu to -646, and 7th year of Nabopolassar to -618.

[BM 76738 and 76813](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm76738_76813.md) contains 
observations of Saturn through the 1st to 14th years of Kandalanu, dating his 1st year to -646.

[BM 35115, 35789, 45640 (ADT V Lunar Text No.3) (LBAT 1415-7)](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm35115_35789_45640.md) 
contains eclipse reports arranged in 18 year groups from the reigns of many different kings, including Shamash-shum-ukin
and Kandalanu. The text indicates Shamash-shum-ukinâ€™s reign was 20 years long, and dates his accession year to -667.

The observations and predictions date Nebuchadnezzar's 14th year to -590.

[BM 38462 (ADT V Lunar Text No.6) (LBAT 1420)](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm38462.md) 
contains eclipse reports from the 1st through to 29th year of Nebuchadnezzar.
The observations and predictions date Nebuchadnezzar's 1st year to -603.

[VAT 4956 (ADT I Diary No. -567)](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/vat4956.md) contains
lunar and planetary observations, lunar six timings, and an eclipse report from the 37th year of 
Nebuchadnezzar conclusively dated to -567.
