# Astronomical Texts

There are a number of texts that describe various astronomical events, such as positions of the moon, stars, planets,
lunar eclipses etc, which allow us to date the reigns of the Babylonian Kings.

This is in itself a very complicated topic and as such I have created a separate project to analyse them: 
[Astro Tablets](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets).

## Summary

[BM 32312](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm32312.md) dates the 16th year of 
Shamash-shum-ukin to -651.
