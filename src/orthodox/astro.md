# Astronomical Texts

There are a number of texts that describe various astronomical events, such as positions of the moon, stars, planets,
lunar eclipses etc, which allow us to date the reigns of the Babylonian Kings.

This is in itself a very complicated topic and as such I have created a separate project to analyse them: 
[Astro Tablets](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets).

## Summary

[BM 32312](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm32312.md) contains planetary
observations from the 16th year of Shamash-shum-ukin dated to -651.

[BM 41222](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm41222.md) contains planetary
observations from the reigns of many different kings, and matches the 14th year of Shamash-shum-ukin to -653, 
1st year of Kandalanu to -646, and 7th year of Nabopolassar to -618.

[BM 76738 and 76813](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm76738_76813.md) contains 
observations of Saturn through the 1st to 14th years of Kandalanu, dating his 1st year to -646.
