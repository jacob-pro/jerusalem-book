# The Ancient Historians on Egypt

## Herodotus

> Psammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped
  at the mouth of the Nile, called the
  Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For Cambyses,
  when he went up against Egypt, found Amasis
  no longer in life: he had died after ruling Egypt
  forty and four years, during all which time no
  great misfortune had befallen him.

> Ten days after the fort had fallen, Cambyses
  resolved to try the spirit of Psammenitus,
  the Egyptian king, whose whole reign had been
  but six months.
