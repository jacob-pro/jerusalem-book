# Egyptian Chronology

The 26th dynasty of Egypt, also known as the Saite period, runs in parallel to the Neo-Babylonian era.

## Synchronisation Points

### Battle at Megiddo

2 Kings 23:29:

> While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. 
> King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed him at Megiddo.

[BM 21901](../chronicles/bm21901.md) Lines 66-67:

> \<The seventeenth year\>: In the month Tammuz Ashur-uballit (II), king of Assyria, the large army of Egypt [...]
> crossed the river (Euphrates) and marched against Harran to conquer (it). [...] they [capture]d (it).

Pharoah Necho was at the battle of Megiddo during the 17th year of Nabopolassar.

### Battle of Carchemish

Jeremiah 46:2:

> This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the 
> Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:

[BM 21946](../chronicles/bm21946.md) Obv. Lines 1-5:

> [The twenty-first year]: The king of Akkad stayed home (while) Nebuchadnezzar (II), his eldest son (and) the crown prince,
  mustered [the army of Akkad]. He took his army's lead and marched to Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates.
  He crossed the river [to encounter the army of Egypt] which was encamped at Carchemish.
  [...] They did battle together. The army of Egypt retreated before him.
  He inflicted a [defeat] upon them (and) finished them off completely.

Pharoah Necho was at the battle of Carchemish, during the 21st year of Nabopolassar.

### Pharaoh Hophra

Jeremiah 44:30:

> ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, 
> just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon

Following the destruction of Jerusalem (in Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year) Hophra (=Apries) is king of Egypt.

### BM 33041

[BM 33041](bm33041.md) shows that Nebuchadnezzar marched against Amasis, king of Egypt, during his 37th year.

## Chronology 

Based on [Egyptian Stelae](stelae.md) and the [Ancient Historians](historians.md) we have:

| King        | Sole Reign |
|-------------|------------|
| Psamtik I   | 54 Years   |
| Necho II    | 15 Years   |
| Psamtik II  | 6 Years    |
| Apries      | 19 Years   |
| Amasis II   | 44 Years   |
| Psamtik III | 6 months   |

Note that Apries did not die in his 20th year, but rather entered into a co-regency with Amasis, ruling
together for at least 3 years [@breasted1909history, 589].
