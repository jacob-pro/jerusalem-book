## Translation

From Col. X [@beaulieu1989reign, 107] see also [@pritchard1969ancient, 311]:

> [As to the temples of the gods] whose storehouses [were empty?] and where they had not established their residence 
> [since.....], Marduk, my lord, waited for me and entrusted me with the restoration of the divine cults. He decreed 
> by his pure utterance the appeasement of the angry gods and my (re)establishment of their dwellings (as a duty) for 
> my rule. (Concerning) H̬arran (and) the Eh̬ulh̬ul, which had been lying in ruins for 54 years because of its devastation 
> by the Medes (who) destroyed the sanctuaries, with the consent of the gods the time for the reconciliation approached, 
> 54 years, when Sîn should return to his place. When he returned to his place, Sîn, the lord of the tiara, remembered 
> his lofty seat, and (as to) all the gods who left his chapel with him, it is Marduk, the king of the gods, who 
> ordered their gathering.
