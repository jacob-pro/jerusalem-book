# Business Tablets

The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for administrative, legal, and economic purposes.
By looking at the dates that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were from, can
show us useful chronological information.

For example the dates have been used in the following publications:

- Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 10]
- A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [@brinkman1983documentary] [@brinkman1986supplement]
- Part II: A Survey of Babylonian Texts, 626-605 B.C. [@kennedy1986documentary]

A more complete survey has been published by J Everling [@everling2013materials], originally available
