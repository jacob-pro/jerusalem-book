# Errors and Corrections

Since there are well over 18,000 datable texts in the survey it is not surprising that there will have been some errors
in the process of copying, translating, and collating the texts. 

I have applied a number of corrections to my own copy of Everling's survey which using Git can be tracked here: 
[CHRON.CHN](https://github.com/jacob-pro/jerusalem-book/blob/master/business_tablets/CHRON.CHN) (try using the blame
and history features).
