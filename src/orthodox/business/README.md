# Business Tablets

The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for administrative, legal, and economic purposes.
By looking at the dates that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were from, can
show us useful chronological information.

For example the dates have been used in the following publications:

- Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 10]
- A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [@brinkman1983documentary] [@brinkman1986supplement]
- Part II: A Survey of Babylonian Texts, 626-605 B.C. [@kennedy1986documentary]

A more complete survey has been published by J Everling [@everling2013materials], originally available 
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207180625/http://www.nexus.hu:80/enkidu/enkidu.html) in text format.
From the survey I have generated bar charts counting the tablets dated to each year of each King's reign.

### Shamash-shum-ukin

![](charts/Shamash-shum-ukin.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- V/28/20 - Borsippa, BM 134973 [@bm134973] (K.142 [@brinkman1983documentary, 36])
- V/30/20 - Babylon, BM 40577 [@bm40577] (K.143 [@brinkman1983documentary, 36])

The tablets therefore show that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years.

### Kandalanu

Earliest dated texts:

- X/6/1 - Babylon, VAT 2963 (L.1 [@brinkman1983documentary, 39])
- XII/10/1 - Sippar?, BM 49326 [@bm49326] (L.2 [@brinkman1983documentary, 39])

![](charts/Kandalanu.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- II/25/21 - Borsippa, BM 26377 [@bm26377] (L.158a [@brinkman1986supplement, 103])
- III/8/21 - Sippar?, BM 50270 [@bm50270] (L.159 [@brinkman1983documentary, 49])
- VIII/?/21 - Babylon, BM 36514 [@bm36514] **"After Kandalanu"** [@wiseman1956chronicles, 91]
- VIII/2/22 - Babylon, BM 40039 [@bm40039] **"After Kandalanu"** [@wiseman1956chronicles, 91]

The tablets therefore show that Kandalanu died somewhere between month III and VIII of his 21st year,
and that during the 22nd year there was no other king in Babylon.

### Nabopolassar

Earliest dated texts:

- II/13?/Acc - ?, NCBT 557 [@goetze1944additions]
- VI/22/Acc - Sippar? BM 49656 [@bm49656]

According to Wiseman: [@wiseman1956chronicles, 93]

> The Chronicle (B.M. 25127, 11. I4-I5) expressly states that Nabopolassar
  sat on the throne of Babylon on the 26th of Marcheswan [VIII] ...
  Unless a scribal error is assumed it would seem, therefore, that
  Nabopolassar was acknowledged king at least at Sippar which had become
  independent of Assyria before the final battle at Babylon.

![](charts/Nabopolassar.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- V/1/21 - KUR.A.DAN.ŠU, A5302 [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 12]
- V/20/21 - ?, PTS 2761 (T.21.14 [@kennedy1986documentary])

The tablets therefore show that Nabopolassar ruled for 21 years.

### Nebuchadnezzar II

Earliest dated texts:

- VI/12/Acc - Uruk?, (YOS 17, 153 [@weisberg1980texts])
- VI/18/Acc - Sippar, BM 49524 [@bm49524] [@wiseman1956chronicles, 84]

![](charts/Nebuchadnezzar%20II.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- VI/21/43 - Uruk, NCBT 286 [@goetze1944additions, 44]
- VI/26/43 - Uruk, AO 06847 (TCL 12,  58 [@contenau1927contrats])

The tablets therefore show that Nebuchadnezzar II ruled for 43 years.

### Awil-Marduk

Earliest dated texts:

- V/?/Acc - Sippar, BM 58872 [@bm58872]
- V/20/Acc - Sippar, BM 75322 [@bm75322]

Note that these texts would overlap with the dates for Nebuchadnezzar II by one month. 
R H Sack "proposes that Nebuchadrezzar bought his son into a co-regency before his death", which D J Wiseman
 agrees "is certainly possible" [@wiseman1974review, 451].

However D B Weisberg disagrees [@weisberg1976review, 68]:

> a possible co-regency of Nebuchadnezzar and Amēl-Marduk does not seem conclusive. ...
> The dates we have for the end of one rule and the beginning of another must be used with an understanding
> of the human factors that led to their recording. An Uruk scribe still dating texts to the reign of a deceased
> king (Nebuchadnezzar) might not have known what was happening at the court. A Sippar scribe dating texts to
> Amēl-Marduk might have picked up the news more quickly.

![](charts/Amel-Marduk.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- V/17/2 - Babylon? (BE 8/1, 34. [@clay1908babylonian, 76])
- X/19/2 - Sippar, BM 61325 [@bm61325] (Cat.BM 7 [@leichty1987catalogue, 36])

Note that the last date (month X) is an anomaly since of 23 texts from Awil-Marduks second year it is the 
only one dated later than month V.

The tablets therefore show that Awil-Marduk ruled for 2 years.

### Neriglissar

Earliest dated texts:

- II/4/Acc - Sippar, BM 75489 [@bm75489]
- V/21/Acc - Babylon, YBC 3765 [@dougherty1929nabonidus, 67]

Note that the first date (month II) is an anomaly since of 40 texts from Neriglissar's accession year it is the 
only one dated prior to month V; it is possibly a mistake [@van1998neriglissar, 228].

![](charts/Neriglissar.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- I/2/4 - Shahrinu, BM 41401 [@bm41401]
- I/6/4 - Uruk, YBC 3433 [@goetze1944additions, 44]

The tablets therefore show that Neriglissar ruled for 4 years.

### Labashi-Marduk

Earliest dated texts:

- I/23/Acc - Uruk, NBC 4534 [@goetze1944additions, 44]
- II/12/Acc - Sippar, BM 67271 [@bm67271]

![](charts/La-bashi-Marduk.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- III/9/Acc - Sippar (EKBK 15 [@strassmaier1893einige, 18])
- III/11/Acc - Uruk, YBC 3817 [@goetze1944additions, 44]

The tablets therefore show that Labashi-Marduk only ruled for part of his accession year.

### Nabonidus

Earliest dated texts:

- II/15/Acc - Našušakuna, (Clay BE 8/1, 39 [@clay1908babylonian, 32])
- III/18/Acc - Sippar, BM 75214 [@bm75214]

![](charts/Nabonid.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- VII/17/17 - Uruk (GCBC 528, GCCI 1, 390 [@dougherty1923archives, 67])
- VIII/10/17 - Uruk, BM 74972 [@bm74972]

The tablets therefore show that Nabonidus ruled for 17 years.

### Cyrus II

Earliest dated texts:

- VII/19/Acc - Sippar, BM 56154 [@bm56154]
- VII/?/Acc - Sippar, (Strassmaier, Cyr 1890, 1 [@strassmaier1890inschriftencyr])

![](charts/Cyrus.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- VIII/19/9 - Hursagkalamma, (OECT 10, 123 [@mcewan1984late, 12])
- XI/26/9 - Uruk, YBC 3985 (YOS 7, 84 [@tremayne1925records, 45])

### Cambyses II

Earliest dated texts:

- VI/12/Acc - Babylon, (Strassmaier, Camb 1890, 1 [@strassmaier1890inschriftencyrcam])
- VI/16/Acc - Babylon, (Strassmaier, Camb 1890, 2 [@strassmaier1890inschriftencyrcam])

Note there is an overlap between the tablets dated to Cambyses in month VI, with the tablets dated in later
months to Cyrus suggesting a co-regency [@dandamayev1992iranians, 93] although this is disputed [@peat1989cyrus].
