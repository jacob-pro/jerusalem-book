# Business Tablets

The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for administrative, legal, and economic purposes.
By looking at the dates that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were from, can
show us useful chronological information.

For example the dates have been used in the following publications:

- Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 10]
- A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [@brinkman1983documentary] [@brinkman1986supplement]
- Part II: A Survey of Babylonian Texts, 626-605 B.C. [@kennedy1986documentary]

A more complete survey has been published by J Everling [@everling2013materials], originally available 
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030207180625/http://www.nexus.hu:80/enkidu/enkidu.html) in text format.
From the survey I have generated bar charts counting the tablets dated to each year of each King's reign.

### Shamash-shum-ukin

![](charts/Shamash-shum-ukin.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- V/28/20 - Borsippa, BM 134973 [@bm134973] (K.142 [@brinkman1983documentary, 36])
- V/30/20 - Babylon, BM 40577 [@bm40577] (K.143 [@brinkman1983documentary, 36])

The tablets therefore show that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years.

### Kandalanu

Earliest dated texts:

- X/6/1 - Babylon, VAT 2963 (L.1 [@brinkman1983documentary, 39])
- XII/10/1 - Sippar?, BM 49326 [@bm49326] (L.2 [@brinkman1983documentary, 39])

![](charts/Kandalanu.svg)

Latest dated texts:

- II/25/21 - Borsippa, BM 26377 [@bm26377] (L.158a [@brinkman1986supplement, 103])
- III/8/21 - Sippar?, BM 50270 [@bm50270] (L.159 [@brinkman1983documentary, 49])
- VIII/?/21 - Babylon, BM 36514 [@bm36514] **"After Kandalanu"** [@wiseman1956chronicles, 91]
- VIII/2/22 - Babylon, BM 40039 [@bm40039] **"After Kandalanu"** [@wiseman1956chronicles, 91]

The tablets therefore show that Kandalanu died somewhere between month III and VIII of his 21st year,
and that during the 22nd year there was no other king in Babylon.

### Nabopolassar

Earliest dated texts:

- II/13?/Acc - ?, NCBT 557 [@goetze1944additions]
- VI/22/Acc - Sippar? BM 49656 [@bm49656]

According to Wiseman: [@wiseman1956chronicles, 93]

> The Chronicle (B.M. 25127, 11. I4-I5) expressly states that Nabopolassar
  sat on the throne of Babylon on the 26th of Marcheswan [VIII] ...
  Unless a scribal error is assumed it would seem, therefore, that
  Nabopolassar was acknowledged king at least at Sippar which had become
  independent of Assyria before the final battle at Babylon.

Latest dated texts:

- V/1/21 - KUR.A.DAN.Å U, A5302 [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 12]
- V/20/21 - ?, PTS 2761 (T.21.14 [@kennedy1986documentary])

The tablets therefore show that Nabopolassar ruled for 21 years.

### Nebuchadnezzar II
