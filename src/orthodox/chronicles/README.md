Concerning the early chronicles Grayson says [@grayson2000assyrian, 14]:

> In conclusion it may be stated that Chronicles 1-7 represent only a small part of a series of
  late Babylonian chronicles which, like all chronicles of category A, were probably resumes or
  extracts made from running accounts which were sometimes kept on writing-boards and these
  running accounts were probably identical with astronomical diaries. The narrative exhibits a
  narrow outlook restricted to matter of concern to Babylonia, but within these confines the
  authors are objective. Their main concern is to record what actually happened. Thus one
  may use these documents as source material for the history of the period with considerable
  confidence in their reliability.
