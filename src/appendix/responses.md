> Dear Ms Alley,

> Thank you for your email concerning the citation of my work in the recent Watchtower article. As you suggest the
> author of this piece is completely misrepresenting what I wrote, both in what they say about the lunar three
> measurement, and in what I say about the possibility of retrocalculation of eclipses (my comments on the latter were
> restricted to a distinct and small group of texts which are different to the Diary they are discussing). Just glancing
> through the Watchtower article I can see that they have also misrepresented the views of other scholars by selective
> quotation out of context.
>
> I've looked at the date of VAT 4956 on several occasions and see no possibility that it can be dated to anything other
> than the conventional date.

> The quotes from my article are correct, but quoted out of context. What I have argued is actually exactly the
> opposite. The Babylonian scholars were good scientists and made accurate records of the celestial phenomena, which can
> be checked by modern astronomers. The historical information of the astronomical diaries can very often also be
> checked with the help of other sources and they are usually correct. This I showed in the rest of my article, which

> The same is true for the historical information of the chroniclers, who were the same people, as I have argued in the

> So I dare to say that the information of Chronicle ABC 5 rev. 12, that Jerusalem was taken for the first time on 2
> Adar 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar = 16 March 597 BC (in the Julian Calendar). The second deportation is dated to 587 and
> 586 BC. From this we do not have Babylonian evidence, but the biblical information is ambiguous.
>
> Of course the historical information of the diaries should be used with caution, as should be done with all historical
> information. The interest of the scholars was in collecting information from the sky with information on earth, and
> they had special interest in the fate of the king and events in Babylon. And they did this with a surprising accuracy.
> Events from far away they heard from “hearsay”, and these events cannot be dated with the same accuracy as the events
> in Babylon. But it is flatly impossible to backdate events twenty years. As happens so often in this kind of
> argumentation: the authors find a few texts with some minor problems, try to solve it be a substantial change in the
> accepted chronology, and so creating thousands of new problems, which they do not (and cannot) solve. The documentary
> basis for the traditional chronology is so overwhelming that it in fact a waste of time to discuss it in great detail.
