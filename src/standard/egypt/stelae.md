Lines 4-5 - Birth:
`He was born in the year 53, second month of the second season (sixth month), day 19, under ... Psamtik`

Lines 6-7 - Death:
`He departed from life [in the year] 16, second month of the first season (second month), day 6 ... Necho`

Line 7 - Lifespan: `The total of his length of life was 16 years, 7 months, and 17 days.`

> This would indicate that Psamtik ruled an even number of complete years, but we cannot suppose that Psamtik I died on
> the last day of the year; it is evident that he died in the fifty-fifth year of his reign, and that the fraction of
> that incomplete year was, after his death, included in the first year of his successor, Necho. It is thus clear that
> the years of the king's reign in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty began on New Year's Day.

Therefore Psamtik I ruled for 54 complete years, before being succeeded by Necho in the 55th year.
