# The Ancient Historians on Egypt

## Herodotus

Psamtik I [@rawlinson1909history2, 32]:

> Psammetichus ruled Egypt for fifty-four years, during twenty-nine of which he pressed the siege of Azôtus without
> intermission, till finally he took the place.

Necho II [@rawlinson1909history2, 34]:

> After having reigned in all sixteen years, Necôs died, and at his death bequeathed the throne to his son Psammis.

Psamtik II and Apries [@rawlinson1909history2, 36]:

> Psammis reigned only six years. He attacked Ethiopia, and died almost directly afterwards. Apries, his son, succeeded
> him upon the throne, who, excepting Psammetichus, his greatgrandfather, was the most prosperous of all the kings that
> ever ruled over Egypt. The length of his reign was twenty-five years,

Amasis: [@rawlinson1909history2, 59]:

> Psammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped at the mouth of the Nile, called the Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For
> Cambyses, when he went up against Egypt, found Amasis no longer in life: he had died after ruling Egypt forty and four
> years, during all which time no great misfortune had befallen him.

Psammenitus: [@rawlinson1909history2, 62]:

> Ten days after the fort had fallen, Cambyses resolved to try the spirit of Psammenitus, the Egyptian king, whose whole
> reign had been but six months.

## Manetho

There are three different sources for Manetho concerning the 26th dynasty; one from Africanus, and two from Eusebius
[@waddell1940manetho, 171]:

```
According to Africanus.

The Twenty-sixth Dynasty consisted of nine kings of Sais.
1. Stephinatês, for 7 years.
2. Nechepsôs, for 6 years.
3. Nechaô, for 8 years.
4. Psammêtichus, for 54 years.
5. Nechaô the Second, for 6 years: he took Jerusalem, and led King Iôachaz captive into Egypt.
6. Psammuthis the Second, for 6 years.
7. Uaphris [Apries], for 19 years: the remnant of the Jews fled to him, when Jerusalem was captured by the Assyrians.

## Comparison

| King        | Stelae                  | Herodotus | Africanus | Eusebius 1 | Eusebius 2 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Psamtik I   | 54 years                | 54 years  | 54 years  | 45 years   | 44 years   |
| Necho II    | + Psamtik II = 21 years | 16 years  | 6 years   | 6 years    | 6 years    |
| Psamtik II  | + Necho = 21 years      | 6 years   | 6 years   | 17 years   | 17 years   |
| Apries      | 19 years (40-21)        | 25 years  | 19 years  | 25 years   | 25 years   |
| Amasis II   |                         | 44 years  | 44 years  | 42 years   | 42 years   |
| Psamtik III |                         | 6 months  | 6 months  |            |            |

We can see that Herodotus and the Egyptian Stelae in agreement with the exception of Apries, although Herodotus is not
necessarily incorrect; Apries did not die in his 20th year, but rather entered into a co-regency with Amasis, ruling
together for at least 3 further years [@breasted1909history, 589].

## Cambyses

Manetho also records [@waddell1940manetho, 175]

```
According to Africanus.
1. Cambysês in the fifth year of his kingship over the Persians became king of Egypt, and ruled for 6 years.
```

```
According to Eusebius.
1. Cambyses in the fifth year of his kingship became king of Egypt, and ruled for 3 years.
```

```
