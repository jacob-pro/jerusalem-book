## Key Information

Obv. Lines 9-10: `For twenty-one years Nabopolassar ruled Babylon. On the eighth day of the month Ab he died.` (8/V/21).

Obv. Line 10-11:
`In the month Elul Nebuchadnezzar (II) returned to Babylon and on the first day of the month Elul he ascended the royal throne in Babylon.`
(1/VI/Acc.).

## Notes

In the earlier translation by Wiseman [@wiseman1956chronicles, 67] victoriously (Obv. 13, 16, 23, Rev. 5) was translated
as 'unopposed', regarding this Albright says [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 31]:

> the adverb means "victoriously," and suggests that the Babylonians met with stiff resistance from both the local
> population and its Egyptian suzerains and allies.

There is also a difference in Obv. 8 where Wiseman put: `Nebuchadrezzar conquered the whole area of the á¸ªatti-country`
which has been corrected to `all of Ha[ma]th`.
