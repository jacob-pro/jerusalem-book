# Standard Babylonian Chronology

This section will look at the sources and methods through which historians have been able to determine and verify the
'standard chronology' [@dubberstein1956babylonian] of the Neo-Babylonian period.

First we will establish a relative chronology, using sources including the Uruk king list, Babylonian Chronicles,
Business tablets, and Nabonidus inscriptions, spanning the reigns from Shamash-shum-ukin to Cambyses II. Then using
Ptolemy's canon, and eight unique astronomical texts we can validate and precisely date these reigns on the Julian
calendar, producing a [timeline](./timeline.md) for the kings of Babylon.

By doing so I will indirectly answer the first question — why historians claim the destruction took place in 586/587 BC
— by showing that Nebuchadnezzar II's 19th regnal year began in spring 586 BC.
