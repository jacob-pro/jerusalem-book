# Standard Babylonian Chronology

This chapter will look at the sources from which historians have been able to determine and confirm the 'standard
chronology' [@dubberstein1956babylonian] of the Neo-Babylonian period.

By doing so I will indirectly answer the first question — why historians claim the destruction took place in 586/587 BC
— by establishing the dates for the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II.
