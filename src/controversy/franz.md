# Raymond Franz

Raymond Victor Franz (1922–2010) was a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses [@watch1973year, 257],
appointed on October 20, 1971.

On May 22, 1980, Franz was ousted from the Governing Body [@watch1980announcements] [@osling1982witness], and then in
November 1981 he was subsequently 'disfellowshipped' (excommunicated) for sharing a meal in a restaurant 'with a person
disassociated from the congregation'; his employer and landlord Peter Gregerson [@franz2004crisis, 355-376]. This
occurred just weeks after the release of a _Watchtower_ article setting out this new policy [@watch1981disfellowshiping,
24]. Later in 1983, he released the first edition of 'Crisis of Conscience' describing his experiences
[@franz2004crisis].

Interestingly, prior to joining the Governing Body, Franz had worked in the writing department at Brooklyn Bethel (Watch
Tower headquarters), where he was one of the main authors of the Watch Tower's Bible dictionary _Aid to Bible
Understanding_ released in 1971 (the predecessor to the _Insight on the Scriptures_ series) [@watch1971aid]. In his book
Franz describes the research that went into writing the 'Chronology' entry for the _Aid_ book [@franz2004crisis, 29-31]:

> Months of research were spent on this one subject of “Chronology” and it resulted in the longest article in the _Aid_
> publication. Much of the time was spent endeavoring to find some proof, some backing in history, for the 607 B.C.E.
> date so crucial to our calculations for 1914. Charles Ploeger, a member of the headquarters staff, was at that time
> serving as a secretary for me and he searched through the libraries of the New York city area for anything that might
> substantiate that date historically.
>
> We found absolutely nothing in support of 607 B.C.E. All historians pointed to a date twenty years later. Before
> preparing the Aid material on “Archaeology” I had not realized that the number of baked-clay cuneiform tablets found
> in the Mesopotamian area and dating back to the time of ancient Babylon numbered into the tens of thousands. In all of
> these there was nothing to indicate that the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (in which period Nebuchadnezzar’s
> reign figured) was of the necessary length to fit our 607 B.C.E. date for the destruction of Jerusalem. Everything
> pointed to a period twenty years shorter than our published chronology claimed.
>
> Though I found this disquieting, I wanted to believe that our chronology was right in spite of all the contrary
> evidence, that such evidence was somehow in error. Thus, in preparing the material for the Aid book, much of the time
> and space was spent in trying to weaken the credibility of the archeological and historical evidence that would make
> erroneous our 607 B.C. E. date and give a different starting point for our calculations and therefore an ending date
> different from 1914.
>
> Charles Ploeger and I made a trip to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, to interview Professor Abraham
> Sachs, a specialist in ancient cuneiform texts, particularly those containing astronomical data. We wanted to see if
> we could obtain any information that would indicate any flaw or weakness whatsoever in the astronomical data presented
> in many of the texts, data that indicated our 607 B.C.E. date was incorrect. In the end, it became evident that it
> would have taken a virtual conspiracy on the part of the ancient scribes—with no conceivable motive for doing so—to
> misrepresent the facts if, indeed, our figure was to be the right one. Again, like an attorney faced with evidence he
> cannot overcome, my effort was to discredit or weaken confidence in the witnesses from ancient times who presented
> such evidence, the evidence of historical texts relating to the Neo-Babylonian Empire. In themselves, the arguments I
> presented were honest ones, but I know that their intent was to uphold a date for which there was no historical
> support.
