# Controversy

In the [standard chronology section](../standard/standard.md) we saw that there is very strong evidence for a 587/586 BC
date for the destruction of Jerusalem. And in the [Watch Tower chronology section](../watchtower/watchtower.md) we saw
that Watch Tower denies this date, relying on faulty logic and misquotations. It is therefore no surprise that this
topic has generated controversy within the Jehovah's Witness community.

The aim of this section is to explore the history and debate within Jehovah's Witnesses surrounding the date for the
destruction of Jerusalem.
