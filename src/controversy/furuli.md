# Rolf Furuli

Rolf Johan Furuli (1942–) was a lecturer in Semitic languages at the University of Oslo [@furuli2010rolf].

Furuli held various roles within the Jehovah's Witness organisation, including serving as an 'elder' for 56 years, as
well as working as a 'circuit overseer' and a 'district overseer' [@furuli2022author]. During that time he published
numerous books defending the Watch Tower society, including its blood policy, the New World Translation of the Bible,
and most notably its chronology.

In his series _Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible_ Furuli
attempted to justify the Watch Tower's 607 BC for the destruction of Jerusalem. However, it was not well reviewed
[@grabbe2004review]:

> Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship. F.’s expertise is admittedly in Semitic languages, and
> his PhD (in progress) is on the Hebrew verbal system. He notes, ‘My disadvantage is that I am neither a professional
> archaeo-astronomer nor a historian’. This has not deterred him from making some radical re-interpretations of
> Achaemenid-period chronology and putting it forward boldly as an ‘Oslo chronology’. Part of his redating is fairly
> modest: he accepts the beginning and end of Achaemenid rule according to the standard dating, and puts the beginning
> of Darius I’s reign only one year later than is conventional. He argues, however, that the first 11 years of Xerxes’
> reign overlap with the last 11 of Darius, and that Artaxerxes I came to the throne in 475 BCE and ruled 51 years. (F.
> has indeed found the interesting fact that a couple of tablets have the years ‘50’ and ‘51’ for Artaxerxes, but he
> admits that overwhelmingly tablets make 41 his last year and none is found between 41 and 50, suggesting the obvious:
> a scribal error.) Gifted amateurs have sometimes revolutionized scholarship, notably M. Ventris and Linear B. But
> Ventris was willing to work with specialists such as J. Chadwick whereas F. shows little evidence of having put his
> theories to the test with specialists in Mesopotamian astronomy and Persian history. Perhaps the most telling point is
> his rather naive argument that the 70 years of Judaean captivity must be a literal 70 years of desolation of the land
> because some biblical passages make such a statement. A second volume is promised; we shall see if it is any more
> convincing.

In 2020, he published the book _My Beloved Religion — And the Governing Body_ criticising the Governing Body of
Jehovah's Witnesses [@furuli2020my]. This attracted attention in the Norwegian press [@gilge2020tar] [@gilge2020tror],
subsequently in June he was 'disfellowshipped' (excommunicated) [@furuli2020min] [@faedrelandsvennen2020ba].
