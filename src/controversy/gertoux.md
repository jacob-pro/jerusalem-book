# Gérard Gertoux

Gérard Marcel Laurent Gertoux (1955–) is a French academic [@gertoux2018curriculum].

Gertoux is also a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, which in 2007 led to a dispute with his PhD supervisors, who described
him as a 'fundamentalist'. This attracted the attention of Human Rights Without Frontiers, who allege he was
discriminated against for his religious affiliation [@hrwf2015freedom].

In 2013 Gertoux released the paper 'Dating the fall of Babylon and Ur thanks to Astronomical Events', in it, he produced
extensive tables covering chronology through the first and second millennium BC. Interestingly, his tables for Babylon
date the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar II and the destruction of Jerusalem to 587 BC [@gertoux2013dating, 18].

In light of his published chronology (which is in contradiction with parts of Watch Tower theology), it is not clear
what relationship he has with the religion today.
