# Judean Chronology

This chapter will look at the chronology of the Kingdom of Judah before and up to the
destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II.

By doing so I will indirectly answer the second question - why is there is a dispute
between the 587 BC and 586 BC dates?

> The Babylonian records describing the destruction of Jerusalem by the
  army of Nebuchadnezzar have not been found. As a consequence, all dates
  for that event must be derived from the scriptural record, as tied to the last
  events prior to the destruction that are described in the Babylonian archives.
  These are the Battle of Carchemish in 605 bc and the initial capture of the
  city and its ruler Jehoiachin in the spring of 597 bc.1 The time between the
  earlier of these two events and the final destruction of Jerusalem was less
  than twenty years. Since the period is fairly well documented in the Scriptures,
  it might be expected that it would not be difficult to establish the year
  in which the city was destroyed and the Babylonian Exile began.<br><br>
  Such, however, has not been the case. Although the Scriptures state that
  the end came in the fourth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, scholars
  are divided on whether this refers to 586 bc or 587 bc. Jeremy Hughes
  listed eleven scholars who preferred the first date and eleven who preferred
  the second.2 Edwin Thiele was among those preferring 586, and this seems
  to be the date most widely used in the popular literature. However, to
  Hughesâ€™s list of those favoring 587 should be added the names of Donald
  Wiseman and Kenneth Kitchen. [@young2004did, 21]
