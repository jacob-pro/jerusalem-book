# Watchtower Interpretation of Daniel 1:1

As listed in the [Watchtower Judean Chronology](solutions/watchtower.md) table the Watchtower dates the
Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Judah as described in 2 Kings 24:1 to sometime in the 8th year of Jehoiakim. 

Unusually however the Watchtower then chooses to interpret
the siege of Jerusalem described in Daniel 1:1 and 2 Chronicles 36:6 as referring to the later siege resulting in 
Jehoiachin's capture (2 Kings 24:10, which was the 11th year of Jehoiakim), rather than the earlier invasion 
resulting in Jehoiakim becoming a vassal for 3 years (2 Kings 24:1).

### Insight Book

> Second Kings 24:1 shows that Nebuchadnezzar brought pressure upon the Judean king “and so Jehoiakim became his 
  servant \[or vassal\] for three years. However, he \[Jehoiakim\] turned back and rebelled against him 
  \[Nebuchadnezzar\].” Evidently it is to this third year of Jehoiakim as a vassal king under Babylon that Daniel 
  refers at Daniel 1:1. It could not be Jehoiakim’s third year of his 11-year reign over Judah, for at that time 
  Jehoiakim was a vassal, not to Babylon, but to Egypt’s Pharaoh Necho. It was not until Jehoiakim’s fourth year
  of rule over Judah that Nebuchadnezzar demolished Egyptian domination over Syria-Palestine by his victory at 
  Carchemish (625 B.C.E. \[apparently after Nisan\]). (Jer 46:2) Since Jehoiakim’s revolt against Babylon led to his 
  downfall after about 11 years on the throne, the beginning of his three-year vassalage to Babylon must have begun 
  toward the end of his eighth year of rule, or early in 620 B.C.E.<br><br>
  Daniel’s account (1:1, 2) states that Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and that Jehoiakim, 
  along with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s hand. However, the account at 
  2 Kings 24:10-15 describes the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin, 
  whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the one who finally capitulated and went out to the 
  Babylonians. It therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city, perhaps in the early part thereof. 
  Jehovah’s prophecy through Jeremiah (22:18, 19; 36:30) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a decent burial; 
  his corpse was to lie unattended outside the gates of Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by 
  night. Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’ (Da 1:2) is not revealed. It may have 
  been in the sense of his dying under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into captivity, so that 
  Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish 
  tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim and commanded that his dead body be thrown 
  outside Jerusalem’s walls. (Jewish Antiquities, X, 97 [vi, 3]) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s death came, it 
  appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.—2Ch 36:6.
  [@watch2018insight1, {1269, JEHOIAKIM}]

> Very little is known of his early life, but he \[Daniel\] tells of being taken to Babylon, likely as a teenage 
  prince, along with other royal offspring and nobles. (Da 1:3-6) This was in Jehoiakim’s third year (as tributary 
  king to Babylon), which third year started in the spring of 618 B.C.E. (Da 1:1) With Jehoiakim’s inglorious death, 
  Jehoiachin, his son, ruled for a few months before surrendering. Early in 617 B.C.E., Jehoiachin and other “foremost 
  men,” also young Daniel (2Ki 24:15), were taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. [@watch2018insight1, {576, DANIEL}]

> At the age of 18 Jehoiachin became king and continued the bad practices of his father. (2Ki 24:8, 9; 2Ch 36:9, ftn) 
  Jehoiachin’s father, Jehoiakim, had been under subjection to Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled in his 
  third year of such vassalage (618 B.C.E.). (2Ki 24:1) This resulted in a siege being laid against Jerusalem. The 
  expression “during that time” (2Ki 24:10) may refer, not to Jehoiachin’s brief reign, but to the general period in 
  which it fits, hence allowing for the siege to have begun during his father Jehoiakim’s reign, as Daniel 1:1, 2 seems 
  to indicate. It appears that Jehoiakim died during this siege and Jehoiachin ascended the throne of Judah. His rule 
  ended, however, a mere three months and ten days later, when he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E. (in the 
  month of Adar, according to a Babylonian chronicle). (2Ki 24:11, 12; 2Ch 36:9; Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, 
  by A. Grayson, 1975, p. 102) In fulfillment of Jehovah’s word through Jeremiah, he was taken into Babylonian exile. 
  (Jer 22:24-27; 24:1; 27:19, 20; 29:1, 2) Other members of the royal household, court officials, craftsmen, and 
  warriors were also exiled.—2Ki 24:14-16; [@watch2018insight1, {1267, JEHOIACHIN}]

### Daniel Book

> Daniel 1:1 reads: “In the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of 
  Babylon came to Jerusalem and proceeded to lay siege to it.” Critics have found fault with this scripture because it 
  does not seem to agree with Jeremiah, who says that the fourth year of Jehoiakim was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar. 
  (Jeremiah 25:1; 46:2) Was Daniel contradicting Jeremiah? With more information, the matter is readily clarified. When 
  first made king in 628 B.C.E. by Pharaoh Necho, Jehoiakim became a mere puppet of that Egyptian ruler. This was about 
  three years before Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father to the throne of Babylon, in 624 B.C.E. Soon thereafter 
  (in 620 B.C.E.), Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah and made Jehoiakim a vassal king under Babylon. (2 Kings 23:34; 24:1) 
  To a Jew living in Babylon, Jehoiakim’s “third year” would have been the third year of that king’s vassal service to 
  Babylon. Daniel wrote from that perspective. Jeremiah, however, wrote from the perspective of the Jews living right 
  in Jerusalem. So he referred to Jehoiakim’s kingship as starting when Pharaoh Necho made him king. 
  [@watch2006pay, 18]

> In 625 B.C.E., Egyptian Pharaoh Necho... led his army to Carchemish... The Babylonian army, led by Crown Prince 
  Nebuchadnezzar, inflicted a devastating blow on Pharaoh Necho’s forces. (Jeremiah 46:2) Riding on the momentum of 
  his victory, Nebuchadnezzar swept over Syria and Palestine and, for all practical purposes, put an end to 
  Egyptian domination in this region. It was only the death of his father, Nabopolassar, that brought a temporary halt 
  to his campaign.<br><br>
  The next year, Nebuchadnezzar—now enthroned as king of Babylon—once again turned his attention to his military 
  campaigns in Syria and Palestine. It was during this period that he came to Jerusalem for the first time. The Bible 
  reports: “In his days Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up, and so Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. 
  However, he turned back and rebelled against him.”—2 Kings 24:1. [@watch2006pay, 31]

### Let Your Kingdom Come

> Later writers quote Berossus as saying that after the battle of Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar extended Babylonian 
  influence into all Syria-Palestine and, when returning to Babylon (in his accession year, 605 B.C.E.), he took 
  Jewish captives into exile. Thus they figure the 70 years as a period of servitude to Babylon beginning in 605 B.C.E. 
  That would mean that the 70-year period would expire in 535 B.C.E.<br><br>
  But there are a number of major problems with this interpretation:<br><br>
  Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar took Jewish captives in his accession year, there are no cuneiform 
  documents supporting this. More significantly, Jeremiah 52:28-30 carefully reports that Nebuchadnezzar took Jews 
  captive in his seventh year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his accession year. Also, Jewish historian 
  Josephus states that in the year of the battle of Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar conquered all of Syria-Palestine 
  “excepting Judea,” thus contradicting Berossus and conflicting with the claim that 70 years of Jewish servitude 
  began in Nebuchadnezzar’s accession year.—Antiquities of the Jews X, vi, 1.  [@watch1981let, 188]

## History of the Interpretation

The idea behind interpreting Daniel 1:1 Jehoiakim as actually referring to the siege
described in 2 Kings 24:10 may have originated with first-century historian Josephus, who
dates the beginning of Jehoiakim's servitude to his 8th year:

> 1\. NOW in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, one whose name was Nebuchadnezzar
  took the government over the Babylonians, who at the same time went up with a great army to
  the city Carchemish, which was at Euphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco
  king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. And when Neco understood the intention of the
  king of Babylon, and that this expedition was made against him, he did not despise his attempt,
  but made haste with a great band of men to Euphrates to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar;
  and when they had joined battle, he was beaten, and lost many ten thousands \[of his soldiers\] in
  the battle. So the king of Babylon passed over Euphrates, and took all Syria, as far as Pelusium,
  excepting Judea.
  But when Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned four years, which was the
  eighth of Jehoiakim's government over the Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an expedition
  with mighty forces against the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim, and threatened upon his
  refusal to make war against him. He was aftrighted at his threatening, and bought his peace with
  money, and brought the tribute he was ordered to bring for three years.
  <br><br>
  2\. But on the third year, upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians made an expedition
  against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute; yet was he disappointed of his hope, for the
  Egyptians durst not fight at this time...
  <br><br>
  3\. Now, a little time afterwards, the king of Babylon made an expedition against Jehoiakim,
  whom he received \[into the city\], and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of this
  prophet, as supposing he should suffer nothing that was terrible, because he neither shut the
  gates, nor fought against him; yet when he was come into the city, he did not observe the
  covenants he had made, but he slew such as were in the flower of their age, and such as were of
  the greatest dignity, together with their king Jehoiakim, whom he commanded to be thrown
  before the walls, without any burial; and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the
  city: he also took the principal persons in dignity for captives, three thousand in number, and led
  them away to Babylon; among which was the prophet Ezekiel, who was then but young. And
  this was the end of king Jehoiakim, when he had lived thirty-six years, and of them reigned
  eleven. But Jehoiachin succeeded him in the kingdom, whose mother's name was Nehushta; she
  was a citizen of Jerusalem. He reigned three months and ten days.
  1\. BUT a terror seized on the king of Babylon, who had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin, and
  that immediately; he was afraid that he should bear him a grudge, because of his killing his
  father, and thereupon should make the country revolt from him; wherefore he sent an army, and
  besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem; but because he was of a gentle and just disposition, he did not
  desire to see the city endangered on his account, but he took his mother and kindred, and
  delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of Babylon... [@whiston1737complete, {Ant X 6-7}]

The earliest reference I could find in the Watchtower index for Daniel 1:1 was the 1946 *Equipped for Every Good Work*;
published a decade before the translation of the Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle [BM 21946](../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md):

> But Daniel 1:1, 2 fixes the start of this first captivity in
  the "third year" of Jehoiakim, who started to reign in
  Judah in 628 B.C. Would not this mean the captivity of
  Daniel and others started in 626 B.C., Jehoiakim's third
  year as king of Judah? No, this could not be, because
  Nebuchadnezzar was not enthroned till the following year,
  625 B.C. Actually, the opening verse of Daniel means that
  in "the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah"
  *as a tributary king of Babylon* "came Nebuchadnezzar king
  of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it". How so? Because
  Jehoiakim was put on the throne by Egyptian decree
  and was tributary to Egypt for several years, but when
  Babylon defeated Egypt Jehoiakim came under Babylonian
  control and so remained for three years, after which three
  year period as tributary to Babylon the Judean king rebelled. 
  (2 Ki. 24:1) That third year as tributary king to
  Nebuchadnezzar was the eleventh and last of his total
  kingship, because the Babylonian monarch came against the
  rebellious Jewish king and quickly completed the conquest
  during the three-month reign of Jehoiakim's successor Jehoiachin.
  Hence 618 B.C. was the time of the first captivity
  and the starting point of history in the book of Daniel. [@watch1946equipped, 225]

And then regarding Daniel 2:1:

> The time of this dream and its interpretation is stated
  as the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Actually,
  Nebuchadnezzar had been reigning over Babylon alone
  much longer than two years. Why, at the time of this dream
  the young captive Daniel had completed his three years of
  special court training and had been introduced to Nebuchadnezzar
  and had gained quite a reputation for wisdom,
  particularly in dreams and visions. In the nineteenth year
  of his reign Nebuchadnezzar was used as God's executioner
  to destroy faithless Jerusalem and end Israel's history as
  an independent Theocratic nation. Then Nebuchadnezzar
  began reigning in a unique way, as the first of the world
  rulers of the Gentile times. In the second year of his reign
  in this special capacity the dream showing the end of Satan's
  organization and rule and the taking over of power
  by Christ's kingdom came to Nebuchadnezzar, as recorded
  at chapter 2 . Here again, as at Daniel 1:1, the peculiarity
  which the writer of this book has of making a secondary
  reckoning of the years of a king's reign is demonstrated.
  He reckons by counting from epochal events within the
  reign that put the king in a new relationship.  [@watch1946equipped, 226]

## Criticism

### "Kingship", Daniel 1:1 and Daniel 2:1

First of all the Watchtower Society is reading Daniel 1:1 in a strange way - where "kingship" is understood to refer
not to the length of Jehoiakim's rule over Judah, but to his time as a vassal to Nebuchadnezzar. Against this
interpretation Mercer argues:

> Several commentators take the third year of Jehoiakim as
  being the last of the three years of servitude to Babylon mentioned
  in 2 Kgs 24:1. This solution is unlikely, for the text of Daniel
  states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem "in the third year of
  the reign of Jehoiakim" (bšnṯ šlwš lmlḵwṯ), not "in the third year
  of the servitude of Jehoiakim" (bšnṯ šlwš lᶜḇwḏh)—as one might
  expect if the statement in Dan 1:1 were derived from 2 Kgs 24:1. [@mercer1989daniel, 180]

This causes an even more substantial problem in that in Daniel 2:1, Daniel speaks with
Nebuchadnezzar during "the second year of his kingship" - which would be impossible if Daniel was taken captive sometime
around the 7th or 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar. This forces the Watchtower to 
use another different interpretation for the meaning of "kingship" in Daniel 2:

> The book of Daniel states that it was in “the second year” of Nebuchadnezzar’s kingship (probably counting from the
  destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. and therefore actually referring to his 20th regnal year) that Nebuchadnezzar 
  had the dream about the golden-headed image. [@watch2018insight2, {481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR}] also 
  [@watch2018insight1, {576, DANIEL}] [@watch2018insight1, {1186, IMAGE}] [@watch2007highlights, 18]

> He had effectively become world ruler in 607 B.C.E. when Jehovah God allowed him to destroy Jerusalem and its temple. 
  In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign as world ruler (606/605 B.C.E.), God sent him a terrifying dream.
  [@watch2006pay, 46]

Regarding the translation of "kingship" / "reign" in Daniel Foley says:

> In understanding the first problem, it may be important that the
  Hebrew word translated reign in Daniel 1:1 (NIV) is malchut which
  appears to be a less specific term for the years of reign than regnal
  years, since its use conveys the thought of “kingship” or “sovereign
  power”... It is often used
  without a specific length of time, (e.g., Ezra 4:5– 6, Nehemiah 12:22,
  Jeremiah 49:34) or used in a different way, as in 2 Chronicles 15:10,
  where the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign (kingship) is probably dated
  from his birth rather than from his accession year. Thus Daniel 1:1
  could be translated “in the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim” and
  could reflect a less precise reckoning that ignores the month to month
  differences and sees his reign beginning in 608 BC and the current year
  being 605 BC, a difference of three years.
  This approach may also help
  us to understand the second problem, since it should be noted that the
  Hebrew word for reign in Daniel 2:1 is also malchut , so 603 BC must
  be the second year of Nebuchadnezzar. [@foley2014time, 33]

> Three major Hebrew words translate as “reign” in the NIV. The first of these
  is yom, the word that means “days” or “years”; for example, 1 Chronicles
  7:2 translated “during the reign of David” is more literally translated
  “during the days (or years) of David.” The second word, malak, occurs 350
  times, and in the book of Kings is usually translated “began to reign” and
  may be a word that specifically targets the regnal years of a king. This word
  is used once in Daniel in Daniel 9:2 with reference to the first year of the
  reign of Darius the Mede. The third word, malchut , occurs ninety times and
  seems to be a somewhat less specific word for “kingship” or alternatively for
  periods of reign calculated using exclusive reckoning. In the book of Daniel
  it is used in Daniel 1:1, 2:1, 5:26, 6:28 (twice), 8:1, and 8:23.  [@foley2014time, {Appendix 6}]

However he still concludes that:

> it would seem most likely that
  Daniel was taken from Jerusalem late in 605 BC for the purpose of being
  trained in Babylonian ways. He completed this training very successfully,
  probably in 602 BC [@foley2014time, 34]

### Death of Jehoiakim

As acknowledged in the Insight book [@watch2018insight2, {480, NEBUCHADNEZZAR}], 
[BM 21946](../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md) states
that `In the month Kislev [IX] the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu`, and then that 
`on the second day of the month Adar [XII] he captured the city (and) seized (its) king.`

According to 2 Chronicles 36:9 and 2 Kings 24:8, Jehoiachin reigned in Jerusalem for 3 months and 10 days, subtracting
this from the end of his rule on 2/XII, his rule must have began (and Jehoiakim must have died) around the end of 
month VIII, which would be before Nebuchadnezzar marched to Jerusalem. [@hyatt1956new, 278]

How can Daniel 1:2 where "Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hand" (NWT) and
2 Chronicles 36:6 where "Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against him \[Jehoiakim\] in order to bind him with two copper
fetters to take him off to Babylon" (NWT) make sense in this context
given that Jehoiakim had already died before Nebuchadnezzar marched against the city?

According to Clines:

> Some kind of an attack upon Jerusalem during the reign of
  Jehoiakim is demanded by the evidence of 2 Chr. 36:6f., which
  recounts that Nebuchadrezzar took Jehoiakim in fetters to BabyIon,
  and also carried off some of the temple vessels. This cannot
  have happened at the time of the siege of Jerusalem in early 597
  B.C., since Jehoiakim died on December 7, 598, just before the
  Babylonian troops set out for Jerusalem. So if the Biblical
  Chronicles tradition is sound, it is reasonable to suppose that at
  some time during his reign 'Jehoiakim took part of the temple
  treasure \[to Babylon\] as a *qatrē*-offering or as *biltu* ('tribute') to
  buy off the Babylonians'. 2 Kings 24:1, 'Nebuchadnezzar came
  up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years', may in turn
  be related to the same circumstances. [@clines1972regnal, 21]

In contrast the siege in the first year of Jehoiachin in 2 Kings 24 is described in an order consistent with
the Babylonian account:

> **6** Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers...<br>
  **8** Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem... 
  **9** He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that his father had done. 
  **10** During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city came
  under siege. (2 Kings 24:6,8-10, NWT)

### Marauder Bands

> **1** In Jehoiakim’s days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against him, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. 
  However, he turned against him and rebelled. **2** Then Jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of Chaldeans, 
  Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it...<br>
  **6** Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
  (2 Kings 24:1,2,6,10 NWT)

According to the Watchtower Society Jehoiakim began his three years servitude in his 8th year "early in 620 B.C.E."
[@watch2018insight1, {1269, JEHOIAKIM}] and then rebelled at the end of the three years resulting in the siege of 
Jerusalem in "618 B.C.E." [@watch2018insight1, {1267, JEHOIACHIN}]. The Insight book also states that it "appears that 
Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city" (or as shown above, he actually died just before it began).

When therefore would the multiple attacks of marauder bands have occured if Jehoiakim's rebellion (at the end of three 
years servitude) is immediately followed by his death and the accession of Jehoiachin?

### The Utensils and the Captives

Comparing the statements (NWT) regarding the loot taken from Jerusalem it does not seem to be consistent to place
Daniel 1:2 and 2 Chronicles 36:7 as the same event as the siege resulting in Jehoiachin's capture:

| Event                                    | 2 Kings                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2 Chronicles                                                                                                                                                                                                | Daniel                                                                                                                           |

Against this argument the Watchtower states in the Kingdom Come book:

> Jeremiah 52:28-30 carefully reports that Nebuchadnezzar took Jews 
  captive in his seventh year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his accession year. [@watch1981let, 188]

However it is already seen that Jeremiah does not contain a complete count of the captives since
it contradicts the number (and also year, depending on interpretation) of captives described in 2 Kings 24:14
(3023 in the 7th year vs 10,000+ in the 8th year), so Jeremiah 52 surely should not be treated as an exhaustive list of
all captives taken by Nebuchadnezzar. [@watch2018insight1, {415, CAPTIVITY}]

### Nebuchadnezzar's Conquest of Hattu

The Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle [BM 21946](../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md) provides a detailed account of
Nebuchadnezzar's activities during his early years as king:

Accession Year:

> \[The twenty-first year\]: The king of Akkad stayed home (while) Nebuchadnezzar (II), his eldest son (and) the crown prince,
  mustered \[the army of Akkad\]. He took his army's lead and marched to Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates.
  He crossed the river \[to encounter the army of Egypt\] which was encamped at Carchemish.
  \[...\] They did battle together. The army of Egypt retreated before him.
  He inflicted a \[defeat\] upon them (and) finished them off completely.
  In the district of Hamath
  the army of Akkad overtook
  the remainder of the army of \[Egypt
  which\] managed to escape \[from\] the defeat and which was not overcome.
  They (the army of Akkad) inflicted a defeat upon them (so that) a single (Egyptian) man \[did not return\] home.
  **At that time Nebuchadnezzar (II) conquered all of Ha\[ma\]th.**
  For twenty-one years Nabopolassar ruled Babylon.
  **In (his) accession year Nebuchadnezzar (II) returned to Hattu. Until the month Shebat
  he marched about victoriously
  in Hattu.**
  In the month Shebat **he took the vast booty of Hattu** to Babylon.
  In the month Nisan he took the hand of Bel and the son of Bel (and) celebrated the Akitu festival.

First Year:

> The first year of Nebuchadnezzar (II): In the month Sivan **he mustered his army and
  marched to Hattu. Until the month Kislev he marched about victoriously in Hattu.
  All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their vast tribute.**
  He marched to Ashkelon and in the month Kislev he captured it,
  seized its king, plundered \[and sac\]ked it.
  He turned the city into a ruin heap. In the month Shebat he marched away and \[returned\] to Bab\[ylon\].

Second Year:

> The sec\[ond year\]: In the month Iyyar **the king of Akkad strengthened his large army and \[marched to Hattu\]**.
  He encamped \[...\] ... large siege towers he moved acr\[oss ...
  ... from the month\] Iyyar until the month **\[... he marched about victoriously in Hattu\]**.

Third Year:

> \[The third year: In the month ..., on\] the thirteenth \[day\] Nabu-shumu-lishir \[...\]
  \[In the month ... **the king of Akka\]d mustered his army and \[marched\] to Hattu.** \[...
  ...\] He brought the vast \[booty\] of Hattu into Akkad. \[...\]

Fourth Year:

> The fourth year: **The king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu. \[He marched about victoriously\] in Hattu.**
  In the month Kislev he took his army's lead and marched to Egypt. (When) the king of Egypt heard (the news) he m\[ustered\] his army.
  They fought one another in the battlefield and both sides suffered severe losses (lit. they inflicted a major defeat upon one another). The king of Akkad and his army turned and \[went back\] to Babylon.

Fifth Year:

> The fifth year: **The king of Akkad stayed home** (and) refitted his numerous horses and chariotry.

Sixth Year:

> The sixth year: In the month Kislev **the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu.** He despatched his army from Hattu and
  they went off to the desert. They plundered extensively the possessions, animals, and gods of the numerous Arabs. In the month Adar the king went home.

Seventh Year:

> The seventh year: In the month Kislev **the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu.
  He encamped against the city of Judah** and on the second day of the month Adar he captured the city (and) seized (its) king.
  A king of his own choice he appointed in the city (and) taking the **vast tribute** he brought it into Babylon.

Notably in the 7th year the chronicle describes the siege of Jerusalem where Jehoiachin is captured, and identifies
it as being in the area of "Hattu". However from the chronicle we can also see that Nebuchadnezzar also marched through
Hattu in his accession, 1st-4th, and 6th years, and even more significantly in the 1st year:

> All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their **vast tribute**.

It therefore seems very unlikely that Jehoiakim did not become a vassal of Nebuchadnezzar until his 8th year
as dated by the Watchtower, instead is it was likely to be sometime as early as the autumn of Nebuchadnezzar's
accession year (the 4th year of Jehoiakim).

Against this argument the Kingdom Come book says:

> Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar took Jewish captives in his accession year, there are no cuneiform 
  documents supporting this.

However the tributes described in the chronicles should be interpreted as including captives, such as in 7th year where
Nebuchadnezzar took "vast tribute", which we already know must have included captives (Jer 52:28, 2 Kings 24:14).

> In the 'accession year' Nebuchadrezzar went back again to the Hatti
  land and until the month of Sebat marched unopposed through the Hatti 
  land; in the month of Sebat he took the heavy tribute of the Hatti territory 
  to Babylon.<br><br>
  It is certain that this 'heavy tribute' consisted not only of treasure 
  but also of prisoners from the conquered countries. To refrain from 
  doing so would have been altogether too alien from the customs of the
  kings of Babylon and Assyria. [@larsson1967when]

## Alternative Solutions

Dates for the start of Jehoiakim's servitude proposed by other authors:

- [Tadmor](./solutions/tadmor.md#subjugation-of-judah): 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar.
- [Jones](./solutions/jones.md#battle-of-carchemish-and-subjugation-of-judah): 20th year of Nabopolassar
  (the year before Nebuchadnezzar's accession).
- [Malamat](./solutions/malamat.md#subjugation-of-judah): Accession, 1st or 2nd years of Nebuchadnezzar.
- [Thiele](./solutions/thiele.md#battle-of-carchemish-and-the-subjugation-of-judah): 21st year of Nabopolassar (after 
  the battle of Carchemish, but prior to Nebuchadnezzar's accession).
- [Albright](./solutions/albright.md#subjugation-of-judah): 1st or 2nd years of Nebuchadnezzar.
- [Hyatt](./solutions/hyatt.md#subjugation-of-judah): Accession or 1st years of Nebuchadnezzar.
- Mercer [@mercer1989daniel, 192]: Midsummer of Nebuchadnezzar's accession year.
- Larsson [@larsson1967when, 419]: Accession year of Nebuchadnezzar.

If we took the [Watchtower Judean chronology](./solutions/watchtower.md) but 
instead dated the subjugation of Jehoiakim to the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar,
then this would fall in the forth year of Jehoiakim, which would actually be the **third** year if we assumed
Daniel were converting Jehoiakim's reign to the Babylonian accession year system - successfully integrating Daniel 1:1.

### Daniel's Training

Assuming that Daniel was taken at some point in Nebuchadnezzar's accession year then we can
count inclusively 3 years of training (Daniel 1:5), but this would be a maximum of about 2 ½ years actual length:

| Nebuchadnezzar | Event                                    | Years of Training |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Accession      | Nebuchadnezzar became king in month 6    | 1st               |
| 1st            |                                          | 2nd               |
| 2nd            | Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream | 3rd               |

There is of course the question of whether this actually matters - do the events in chapter 2 do have to follow the
3 years training or could they have taken place concurrently?

> it simply would not be
  possible that Daniel and his three friends could
  be so highly elevated in the affairs of the
  government of Babylonia in chapter 2 (Dan.
  2:48, 49) and afterward still have to appear
  before King Nebuchadnezzar to obtain his
  approval by proving their abilities “to stand in
  the king’s palace” (Dan. 1:4, 18–20) as though
  they were yet mere students. But such would
  be the case were the happenings of chapter 2
  imbedded somewhere within the three-year
  time frame of chapter 1. [@jones2019chronology, 189]

> Further, it may be urged that the dates in Daniel are not
  self-consistent, and that it is not worth attempting to justify the
  date in Dan. 1:1. If Daniel was taken to Babylon c. June-July
  605, and immediately began his three-year education (1:5), he
  cannot have completed his education before the end of the '2nd
  year of Nebuchadnezzar' (ended 9 April, 602) in which the king
  had his dream (2:1) and Daniel, already graduated (1:18ff.), gave
  its interpretation. This conclusion could be avoided only if it were
  maintained that the '3 years' of 1:15 (sic) are counted inclusively; but
  against that must be set the evidence for a fixed period of 3 full
  years' education, at least in the Persian court. [@clines1972regnal, 28]

> Some commentators hold that the three years of Dan 1:5 were not
  three full years (e-g., Driver, p. 17; Young, pp. 55-56). They would say that Daniel
  was trained during the latter part of Nebuchadnezzar's accession year, all of his first
  year, and part of his second year. That then would harmonize Dan 1:5 and 2:1. The
  fact that the three years were a specific period of time set up for education would
  suggest, however, that the years were three whole years, not a part of three. There is
  also some evidence that in the Persian period the length of training was indeed three
  full years (Montgomery, p. 122). [@mercer1989daniel, 187]

> It should be noted, however, that Dan 2 does not necessarily
  follow Dan 1 chronologically. In addition, the text of Dan 2
  suggests that he was not finished with his training. After all,
  Daniel was evidently not among those who were unable to interpret
  the dream (vv. 2-1 1; cf. v. 27), nor had he even been informed of the
  matter (v. 15). Thus it is entirely possible that Dan 2 records an
  incident that took place after the story in Dan 1:8-17, but before the
  end of the three-year period. [@mercer1989daniel, 187]

### Timing of Jehoiakim's Rebellion

> The revolt in 601 might have
  been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt,
  whose new strength is evident from the defeat inflicted
  by Necho on the attacking armies of Babylon in that
  year. [@tadmor1956chronology, 229]

> In his 3rd and 4th years Nebuchadrezzar was back in Hatti. In the
  latter year he came into direct conflict with the Egyptian army. After
  telling of his marching unopposed in Hatti, the chronicle goes on to say:
  "In the month Kislev \[beginning November 20, 601\] he took the lead
  of his army and marched to Egypt. The king of Egypt heard, and
  mustered his army. In open battle they smote the breast of each other
  and inflicted great destruction upon each other. The king of Akkad
  and his army turned around, and went back to Babylon" (Rev. 11. 6-7).
  The laconic account of the next year is that the king of Akkad remained
  at home "and gathered together his chariots and horses in great numbers"
  (Rev. 1. 8). The outcome of this battle must have been defeat for the
  Babylonian army, or at best a draw. This battle must lie back of Jehoiakim's
  change of allegiance, when he withheld tribute from Babylonia,
  probably making an alliance with Egypt. II Kings 24:1 says that this
  occurred three years after Jehoiakim became the servant of Nebuchadrezzar;
  three full years after the submission of Jehoiakim in either 605
  or 604 would bring us to this date. It is impossible to tell whether Jehoiakim's
  change of allegiance brought on the invasion by Nebuchadrezzar,
  or whether Jehoiakim rebelled after he saw the success of Egypt.
  The latter seems more logical. [@hyatt1956new, 280]

> At an unspecified time in his fourth year (30
  Mar. 601-18 Mar. 600), Nebuchadnezzar returned to Palestine. It
  was during this campaign (in late 601) that Babylon and Egypt
  fought to a standstill, and Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to Babylon
  with no tribute. It was also during this campaign that Jehoiakim
  of Judah, who had paid tribute for the past three years, rebelled
  against the Babylonians. This understanding fits 2 Kgs 24:1, which
  states: "In his \[Jehoiakim's\] days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
  came up, and Jehohiakim became his servant for three years; but
  then he turned and rebelled against him." [@mercer1989daniel, 188]

> The impetus behind Jehoiakim's rebellion was probably his
  renewal of ties with his original overlord, Necho of Egypt, who
  had made him king (2 Kgs 23:34-35). Jehoiakim's ability to extradite
  gives evidence that he was at one time a vassal of Egypt (cf.
  Jer 26:22-23). Necho also imposed a very modest amount of
  tribute. Jehoiakim was a part of the pro-Egyptian party in
  Jerusalem and probably hoped that Necho would help him against
  the Babylonians. This renewed alliance would explain Nebuchadnezzar's
  march to Egypt in 601. [@mercer1989daniel, 190]

It would seem likely that Jehoiakim's rebellion was connected with the Egyptian war in Nebuchadnezzar's 4th year,
counting back 3 full years during which Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar would mean that he must have become
vassal somewhere around the accession or 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar.
