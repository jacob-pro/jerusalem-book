# Principles of Chronology

> In working out the chronology of a nation, a primary requisite
  is that the chronological procedure of that nation be understood.
  The following items must be definitely established: (1) the year
  from which a king began to count the years of his reignâ€”whether from the time
  of his actual accession, from the following year, or from some other time; (2) the
  time of the calendar year when a king began to count his reign; (3) the method
  according to which a scribe of one nation reckoned the years of a king of a
  neighboring state, whether according to the system used in his nation or according
  to that of the neighbor; (4) whether or not the nation made use of
  coregencies, whether or not several rival rulers might have been reigning at the
  same time, and whether interregna occurred; (5) whether during the period
  under review a uniform system was followed, or whether variations took place;
  and, finally, (6) some absolute date during the period in question from which
  the years can be figured backward and forward so that the full chronological
  pattern might be secured.
  An understanding of each of the above items is necessary to a correct
  reconstruction of the chronologies of Israel and Judah, for unless one is acquainted
  with the type of chronological procedure in use, a wrong interpretation
  is likely to be placed on the available data and cause an erroneous pattern
  to ensue. [@thiele1983mysterious, 43]

## Accession and Non-Accession Year Reckoning

### Accession Year Reckoning

> In Assyria, Babylon, and Persia when a king first came to
  the throne, the year was usually called the king's accession year, but not till the
  first day of the first month of the next new year did the king begin reckoning
  events in his own first year. This system of reckoning is called the accession year
  system, or postdating. [@thiele1983mysterious, 43]

| 603 BC |              | 2              |

### Non-Accession Year Reckoning

> In other places a king began to reckon his first year
  from the day he first came to the throne. This method of reckoning is known as
  the nonaccession-year system, or antedating. [@thiele1983mysterious, 43]

## Start of the Regnal Year

Whilst we know the Babylonians began their calendar year at Nisanu in Spring 
([see Calendar](../introduction/calendar.md)), the situation in Judah is more complex:

> Among the Hebrews there were two calendar years, one beginning with
  Nisan in the spring and the other with Tishri in the fall. 
  With which of these
  months did the Hebrews begin reckoning their regnal years? And did both
  Israel and Judah follow the same practice? [@thiele1983mysterious, 44]

No consensus has yet been reached whether the Judean kings regnal years were
reckoned from Nisan or Tishri [@clines1974evidence].
