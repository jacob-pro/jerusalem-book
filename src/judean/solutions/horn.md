# Horn's Chronology

Siegfried Herbert Horn (1908-1993) was a Seventh-day Adventist biblical archaeology professor [@andrews_horn].

The key assumptions of his chronology include:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system [@horn1967babylonian, 23].

> The kingdom of Judah in the pre-exilic period
  used an autumn-to-autumn civil year, and applied it to the
  reckoning of the regnal years not only of their own kings but
  also of foreign kings as well, and this practice remained in force
  among many post-exilic Jews.  [@horn1967babylonian, 24]

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

> Those, however, who believe that a civil year beginning in
  autumn was used in Judah to reckon the regnal years of the
  kings, are forced to assume that Jehoahaz was not deposed
  until after Tishri I (Sept. 21), because data contained in the
  Babylonian Chronicles, not yet discussed, make it certain
  that Jehoiakim, the successor of Jehoahaz, began his first
  regnal year in 608, either in the spring or in the autumn, and
  that his first year cannot have started in the autumn of
  609\. According to this reasoning the Battle of Megiddo
  cannot have taken place earlier than in Tammuz, the same
  month in which the Assyrian and Egyptian armies crossed
  the Euphrates. In no other way could Jehoahaz have reigned
  for three months and still be deposed after Tishri I. [@horn1967babylonian, 19]

Again this would appear to raise the question of whether there is enough time for Neco and the Egyptian army
to travel from Megiddo to Carchemish before the end of Tammuz (month IV):

> The campaign against Haran
  by the Assyrians and Egyptians began with the crossing of
  the Euphrates in Tamrnuz (June 25 to July 23) and ended
  with their retreat in Elul (Aug. 23 to Sept. 20). This means
  that the campaign could have begun as early as the end of
  June or as late as the second half of July. The distance from
  Megiddo to Carchemish is approximately 340 miles and must
  have taken the Egyptian army nearly a month to cover. This
  leads to the conclusion that the Battle of Megiddo could
  hardly have ended later than the middle of June, if the
  advance toward Haran started in the latter part of Tammuz.
  It could have been earlier, if the crossing of the Euphrates
  took place in the early part of Tammuz. [@horn1967babylonian, 17]

### Battle of Carchemish

> In Jer 25:1, the 4th year of Jehoiakim of
  Judah is equated with the 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar. This
  was the autumn-to-autumn year 605/604. [@horn1967babylonian, 26]

> The only problem text seems to be Jer 46:2, 'which states that
  the Battle of Carchemish took place in the 4th year of Jehoiakim,
  which according to the Jewish calendar was the year 605/604, autumn-to-autumn.
  But we know now that the Battle of Carchemish took
  place in the spring of 605, before Nabopolassar's death. This difficulty
  can be explained only in one of two ways: (I) Either the passage of
  Jer 46:2 contains a scribal error made by the author, compiler or a
  copyist, or (2) the date refers not to the battle itself but rather to
  the time when the prophecy was issued. I therefore, venture to suggest
  that Jer 46:1-2 be read in the following way: "The word of Yahweh
  which came to Jeremiah the prophet, against the nations; about Egypt:
  against the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt (which had been at
  the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadrezzar king
  of Babylon had defeated) in the 4th year of Jehoiakim the son of
  Josiah, king of Judah." If the portion of the verse referring to the
  Battle of Carchemisch is considered a parenthetical clause, all chronological
  difficulties are removed, and this passage falls in line with the
  rest of the dated historical statements of Jeremiah mentioning
  Nebuchadnezzar. <br>
  In this case one has to assume that the parenthetical clause was
  inserted in the introduction to Jeremiah's message to point out that
  the prophetic oracle was pronounced over the Egyptian army which
  had been badly mauled several months before, perhaps as long ago
  as a year. It is true that in this way the passage shows an artificial
  and unnatural grammatical construction, for which reason this interpretation
  may not appeal to many scholars, but one should at least
  admit the possibiIity that the text can be interpreted in such a way
  that the chronological difficulties, which otherwise exist, can be
  removed. That translators from the LXX to our time have applied
  the date as referring to the battle is no proof that the traditional
  reading is correct. Since numerous parallels of similar parenthetical
  clauses have been recognized in many other Biblical passages, this
  one need not be rejected as an isolated case. [@horn1967babylonian, 25]

### Seiges of Jerusalem

Horn does not appear to explain where the subjugation of Judah (2 Kings 24:1, Daniel 1:1) during Jehoiakim's reign,
would fit in.

> This double reckoning of Nebuchadnezzar's regnal years by
  the Babylonian and Jewish annalists accounts for the
  apparent discrepancy between the data with regard to the
  date of Jehoiachin's capture; for the Babylonian Chronicles
  place this event in the 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar, while 2
  Ki 24:12 puts it in the 8th year. The 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar
  according to the Babylonian spring calendar lasted
  from March 27, 598 to April 12, 597, but according to the
  Jewish autumn calendar it had already ended in the autumn
  of 598, when Nebuchadnezzar's 8th year had begunaS0H ence,
  both documents, the Babylonian Chronicles as well as 2 Ki
  24:12, contain accurate information in spite of their apparent
  contradictions. [@horn1967babylonian, 25]

> The fall and final
  destruction of Jerusalem is dated in 2 Ki 25:8 and in Jer
  52:12 in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, which coincided
  with the 11th year of Zedekiah of Judah (2 Ki 25:2; Jer 39:2;
  52:5). That year was the autumn-to-autumn year 587/586,
  as has already been pointed out.<br>
  The two deportations of Jews recorded in Jer 52:28-30
  which took place in the 7th and 18th years of Nebuchadnezzar
  must have been secondary and minor deportations, and
  cannot refer to deportations which took place after Jehoiachin's
  capture in 597 and after the fall and destruction of Jerusalem
  in 586, because of the small number of deportees. For the
  deportation of 597 our sources in 2 Ki 24:14 and 16 mention
  10,000 and 8,000 deportees respectively. Therefore, the
  deportation of 3,023 according to Jer 52:28 in the preceding
  year (the 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 599/598, autumn-to-autumn)
  must have been in connection with the harassment
  of Jehoiakim by "bands of the Chaldeans" to which 2 Ki
  24:2 refers  [@horn1967babylonian, 26]
