# Thiele's Chronology

Edwin R. Thiele (1895-1986) was a Seventh-day Adventist missionary in China, editor, archaeologist, writer, and Old
Testament professor [@car1996thiele].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@thiele1983mysterious, 180]:

> A careful examination indicates that all biblical writers of this period used the accession-year system for Hebrew,
> Babylonian, and Persian kings.

> But there were wide diversities concerning the months with which regnal years began. The recorders in Kings continued
> to use Tishri years for Hebrew kings and apparently also for Babylonian rulers.

> Such writers as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, and Zechariah used Nisan years for Hebrew kings and also for the rulers of
> Babylon and Persia.

> Daniel used Tishri years for Hebrew kings.

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

Thiele claims that Josiah was killed at Megiddo in month IV (the same month as the attack on Harran) and that afterwards
Jehoahaz ruled for 3 months into Tishri (month VII) [@thiele1983mysterious, 182].

He does not appear to explain how the Egyptian army could have made the ~400 mile journey from Megiddo to Harran within
this timeframe [@clines1972regnal, 30].

### Battle of Carchemish and the Subjugation of Judah

Thiele dates the subjugation of Judah at the same time as the battle of Carchemish [@thiele1983mysterious, 183]:

> Nabopolassar stayed at home in his twenty-first year, beginning with Nisan, 605, but sent Nebuchadnezzar with the army
> against Carchemish. A disastrous defeat was inflicted on the Egyptians. A remnant that fled to Hamath was wiped out
> with the result that "Nebuchadnezzar conquered the whole area of the Hatti-country." This includes all of Aram and the
> territory south to the borders of Egypt. Babylon rather than Egypt was now the master in Palestine. This was the
> attack mentioned in Daniel 1:1 that took place in the third year of Jehoiakim and in which Daniel and his companions
> were taken to Babylon. It should be noticed that this was the third year of Jehoiakim according to Tishri reckoning,
> but the fourth year according to Nisan years as mentioned in Jeremiah 46:2.

However, Thiele is referencing the older publication of [BM 21946](../../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md#notes), which
incorrectly translates 'Hamath' as 'Ḫatti-country', Malamat arguest against this interpretation [@malamat1975twilight,
130]:

> the Chronicle itself does not bear out any widespread conquests in the West while Nebuchadnezzar was still Crown
> Prince. Immediately after the victory at Carchemish, as we now know, Nebuchadnezzar conquered only the "entire land of
> Ha\[ma\]th", and not the "entire land of Hatti" (that is, Syria-Palestine), as formerly read.

Thiele interprets Jeremiah 25:1 as referring to Nebuchadnezzar's accession year rather than 1st year
[@thiele1983mysterious, 184]:

> The battle of Carchemish at the Euphrates in the fourth year of Jehoiakim is now definitively dated by Babylonian
> evidence (B.M. 21946) in the twenty-first year of Nabopolassar, 605 B.C In Jeremiah 25:1 the fourth year of Jehoiakim
> is equated with "the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon." Tadmor has pointed out that this השנה הראשנית of
> Nebuchadnezzar refers not to his official first year but to his initial year on the throne. the year of his accession.

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

Jehoiachin's capture is explained in the context of Nisan vs Tishri years [@thiele1983mysterious, 186]:

> The biblical account places the capture of Jerusalem in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:12), but the
> Babylonian account places it in the seventh year. The Babylonian account is in accord with Nisan regnal years and the
> biblical account starts the years of Nebuchadnezzar with Tishri. The last half of the Babylonian Nisan year overlaps
> the first half of the Hebrew Tishri year. Thus Jerusalem fell to Nebuchadnezzar in his seventh year according to his
> own reckoning but in his eighth year according to the reckoning in Kings. The overlap was from Tishri in the fall of
> 598 to Nisan in the spring of 597. Since Jerusalem fell in Adar, the last month of the Babylonian year, this was in
> the spring of 597.

And likewise for Zedekiah [@thiele1983mysterious, 190]:

> The last event in the checkered history of the southern kingdom was the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by
> Nebuchadnezzar. This siege began on the tenth day of the tenth month of Zedekiah's ninth year (2 Kings 25:1; Jer.
> 39:1; 52:4; cf. Ezek. 24:1-2), 15 January 588. The next year, in the midst of the siege, Jeremiah was imprisoned, this
> being the tenth year of Zedekiah and synchronizing with the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 32:1), 587. Famine
> prevailed, the city was broken, and the king fled, on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year (2
> Kings 25:2-3; Jer. 39:2; 52:5-7), 18 July 586. On the seventh day of the fifth month the final destruction of the city
> began (2 Kings 25:8-10), 14 August 586. This was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 25:8; Jer. 52:12),
> which was from Nisan 586 to Nisan 585, Babylonian reckoning, or Tishri 587 to Tishri 586, Judean years. Gedaliah, who
> had been appointed by Nebuchadnezzar as governor of the land, was slain in the seventh month (2 Kings 25:22-25; Jer.
> 41:1-2). The month of Tishri began on 7 October 586. It must have been shortly after that, that the remnant left by
> Nebuzaradan with Gedaliah took Jeremiah and forced him to accompany them to Egypt (Jer. 43:2-7). Word of the fall of
> Jerusalem reached the captives in Babylon on the fifth day of the tenth month of the twelfth year of their captivity
> (Ezek. 33:21), 8 January 585. Zedekiah's reign thus was from 597 to 586.

Thiele does not offer any explanation for how the difference in the number of captives in Jeremiah 52:28-30 — there is
no reference to this in his scripture index [@thiele1983mysterious, 253].

### Release of Jehoiachin

Thiele counts Jehoiachin's 37 years of captivity on a Tishri-to-Tishri calendar [@thiele1983mysterious, 190]:

> It should be noted that, according to the reckoning of Kings, the thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin's captivity was
> from Tishri 562, to Tishri 561. But according to Ezekiel's and Jeremiah's method of reckoning, the thirty-seventh year
> of the captivity would not begin until Nisan 561.
