# Jones's Chronology

Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones is a Southern Baptist minister and former geologist [@jones2021ministries].

The key assumptions of his chronology include:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system [@jones2019chronology, 130].
- A Nisan to Nisan year was used in Judah [@jones2019chronology, 118].

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

> Thiele placed the Josiah-Neco confrontation in
  the 17th year of Nabopolassar (609 BC). But
  then he added that Josiah perished in the
  month of Tammuz (June–July) as Chronicles
  3:66–67 gives that month as the beginning of
  the Assyrian-Egyptian counterattack against
  Haran.2 This decision resulted in his placing
  the three-month reign of Jehoahaz (2 Kings
  23:31) from Tammuz (June–July) to sometime
  in September or October, yet neither is correct.<br><br>
  Thiele failed to consider logistics. It could have
  easily taken as much as several months for
  Neco to regroup and rest his troops after the
  Battle of Megiddo, then march his massive
  army some 425± miles over often rugged to
  mountainous terrain in order to join with the
  Assyrian’s under Ashur-uballit II. After again
  resting his soldiers (they must be fit to fight
  man-to-man with swords, spears and bows), the
  two kings must lay out battle plans, recross the
  Euphrates River, march their immense joint
  forces some 70 miles to Haran, and finally
  launch the attack. Thus, Josiah could hardly
  have been killed in the month of Tammuz.
  Accordingly, he was slain months earlier.<br><br>
  Moreover, charting the data quickly clarifies
  the matter (see next page and Chart 5c). From
  this, it will be seen that Josiah had to have died
  near mid-March (Adar) but shortly before Nisan
  1 of 609 BC (Tuesday, March 20th, Gregorian). [@jones2019chronology, 188]

### Battle of Carchemish and Subjugation of Judah

> First, it will be observed that the fourth year of
  Jehoiakim is placed in the year of the Battle of
  Carchemish (605 BC) in agreement with Jer.
  46:2. However, Jer. 25:1 also speaks of the
  fourth year of Jehoiakim saying: “that was the
  first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon”
  (see diagram on page 126). How may this
  apparent discrepancy be reconciled?<br><br>
  The Hebrew words for “first year” in Jer. 25:1
  are השנה הראשנית (hashshanah haroshniyth).
  Not being found elsewhere in Scripture, the
  phrase is unique and the feminine singular
  form of the adjective modifying the word “year”
  can mean either “first or beginning”. Thus the
  phrase in Jer. 25:1 is seen as not referring to
  Nebuchadnezzar’s official first year but to his
  initial year on the throne, the year of his
  accession. [@jones2019chronology, 125]

Jones places Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Judah in the 3rd year of Jehoiakim as stated in Daniel 1:1, which
would actually be in the year prior to Nebuchadnezzar's accession. He believes this is necessary to fit 3 years
of Daniel's training (Daniel 1:5):

> The first step in resolving this issue revolves
  around the fact that it simply would not be
  possible that Daniel and his three friends could
  be so highly elevated in the affairs of the
  government of Babylonia in chapter 2 (Dan.
  2:48, 49) and afterward still have to appear
  before King Nebuchadnezzar to obtain his
  approval by proving their abilities “to stand in
  the king’s palace” (Dan. 1:4, 18–20) as though
  they were yet mere students. But such would
  be the case were the happenings of chapter 2
  imbedded somewhere within the three-year
  time frame of chapter 1. Accordingly, the
  context of chapter 2 clearly follows *after* chapter
  1 chronologically.
  Since chapter 1 encompasses most of a three year
  span (cp. vv. 4, 5, 18), then the events in
  chapter 2 must have occurred after Daniel’s
  schooling. Thus, the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s
  reign must take place after Daniel’s
  and the other princes of Judah’s “graduation”.  [@jones2019chronology, 189] 

> It follows then that Daniel 1:1 does not conflict
  with Jeremiah 25:1 as is often claimed.
  Observe that Daniel 1:1 does not say that the
  third year of the reign of Jehoiakim is the first
  year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. As illustrated,
  such would be impossible from the data in
  chapter 1 when compared to 2:1 which is said to
  occur in Nebuchadnezzar’s second year of
  dominion. Moreover, Daniel 1:1 is merely a
  statement of identification, i.e., the Nebuchadnezzar
  who came and besieged Jerusalem in
  Jehoiakim’s third year is the same man who
  ascended to the throne and became sole rex the
  following year (Jer. 25:1). The apparent contradiction
  has been resolved by simply allowing
  the Scriptures to speak for themselves, apart
  from profane materials. [@jones2019chronology, 190] 

#### Criticism

Against Jones' dating for Daniel 1:1 Ian Foley argues [@foley2014time, 31]:

> Jones (2004, 189) takes the view that the only possible solution to this first problem is that Nebuchadnezzar 
  must have besieged Jerusalem and Daniel must have been exiled in 606 BC. However, this solution creates as many 
  problems as it solves because (1) Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king in 606 BC. (However, he was crown prince, and 
  perhaps the title of "king" could be used), (2) Jones uses nonaccession year reckoning for the regnal years of 
  Nebuchadnezzar so that his second year is 604 BC, and it is not clear why he did not use accession year reckoning 
  to make Nebuchadnezzar's second year 603 BC. (3) Until the defeat of the Egyptians at the Battle of Carchemish 
  in 605 BC, there is strong evidence that Egypt controlled Judah and Palestine and that Nebuchadnezzar's expeditions 
  prior to that involved conflict with Egypt in Syria and further north, and (4) there are other solutions to the 
  two problems that would satisfy Jones's view of biblical inspiration without the need to 
  propose Daniel's exile in 606 BC.

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

> However, the Hebrew account seems to conflict
  with the Babylonian record. It declares that the
  second deportation which brought Jehoiachin to
  Babylon, whereupon Zedekiah was placed on
  the throne in Jerusalem, occurred in the 8th
  year of Nebuchadnezzar.<br><br>
  The “discrepancy” resolves itself when it is seen
  that the Babylonian account has Jerusalem
  falling into their hands on 2 Adar.2 Now Adar
  is the 12th and final month of the 7th year. It
  naturally follows that selecting a vassal, establishing
  a new government, cutting in pieces the
  gold vessels in the Temple (2 Kings 24:13) and
  preparing the vast booty for transport before
  returning to Babylon requires time. Moreover,
  2 Kings 24:14–16 tells us that the populace was
  divided and all the leaders, the most affluent,
  the surviving warriors of valor, masons, smiths,
  and carpenters – at least 10,000 of the cream of
  Judah’s citizenry – were separated from the
  poorest of the common people and then carried
  away to the Chaldean homeland. Such an
  undertaking would also have required time. <br><br>
  Indeed, the Hebrew Text reveals the precise
  length of that interval! In 2 Chron. 36:9–10 we
  learn that, after a reign of three months and ten
  days, “when the year was expired” Jeconiah
  (Jehoiachin) was brought to Babylon. Hence,
  this very brief but undefined time after 1 Nisan
  of the next year would fall in the eighth year of
  Nebuchadnezzar [@jones2019chronology, 126]

On the deportations at the end of Jeremiah, in the 7th and 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar:

> Yet, inconceivably,
  the later portion of Jeremiah 52 seems to record
  the fall of Jerusalem as having taken place in
  the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar rather than in
  his 19th (which was Zedekiah’s 11th).
  To begin with, these verses are not recorded in
  2 Kings 25. Jeremiah 52:28–34 seems to be an
  addendum – possibly written by Ezra in
  Babylon after Jeremiah’s death (It is noteworthy
  that it is not part of the text of the
  LXX.).<br><br>
  Being so small a number, most suppose verses
  28–30 are referring to only the adult males of
  importance. Yet, how can we conclude that only
  4,600 Jews were carried away in all of
  Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions when we know at
  least 10,000 of prominence were carried away at
  one time with Jeconiah in 597 BC (2 Kings
  24:12–16)?<br><br>
  Indeed, the very fact that 2 Kings 24:12–16
  records the removal of these 10,000 in the
  eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar demands that
  Jer. 52:28 where 3,023 were said to have been
  carried away in that monarch’s seventh year is
  referring to a completely separate event. The
  differing numbers should alert us that it is not
  merely a matter of attempting to reconcile
  Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh with his eighth year
  by “Hebrew reckoning” or “Babylonian reckoning”
  that is in view here. Two different happenings
  are before us.<br><br>
  It follows that if these are not equivalent, and
  thus should not be associated, then the same is
  true for trying to force the “18th year” of Jer.
  52:29 to match the “19th year” of Jer. 52:12 and
  2 Kings 25:8. Hence, it seems most reasonable
  to conclude with Ussher that there were three
  significant deportations – in 606 BC (when
  Nebuchadnezzar was general-of-the-army and
  crown prince, Dan.1:1), as well as his 8th, and
  19th regnal years — which are to be distinguished
  from the minor ones that Jer. 52:28–30
  lists in his 7th, 18th, and 23rd years. These
  latter, then, were likely added after the fact to
  complete the historical record.<br><br>
  If so, the first minor deportation, reported by
  Jeremiah to have transpired in Nebuchadnezzar’s
  7th year, would have been those seized by
  the bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, etc. whom the
  king of Babylon sent against Judah prior to his
  coming (2 Kings 24:2). That in the 18th year
  would correspond to when the Chaldeans broke
  off the siege of Jerusalem to meet Pharaoh’s
  approaching army. Afterward, it may have
  been deemed prudent to march the swelling
  number of Egyptian and Jewish prisoners in
  the camp off to Babylon. [@jones2019chronology, 127]

### Release of Jehoiachin

> Moreover, in the first year of his reign, Evil
  Merodach (Amel-Marduk), Nebuchadnezzar’s
  son and successor, liberated Jehoiachin from
  prison and raised him to a position of honor at
  the palace (562 BC, the 18th Jubilee — Jer.
  52:31–34). Evil Merodach’s kind, respectful
  treatment of Jehoiachin after 37 years’ imprisonment
  further substantiates the correctness of
  the above assertions. [@jones2019chronology, 128]

Jones appears to be counting 37 years on the Anno Mundi (Year After Creation) calendar
which begins its new year in Tishri.

> This resulted in
  fixing the year of “the captivity” as AM 3407. 
  The relevant Scriptures relating
  to the reigns of the kings of Judah were then
  charted in terms of AM years. This resulted in
  fixing the year of “the captivity” as AM 3407.
  Inclusively numbering 37 years from this first
  year of Jeconiah’s (Jehoiachin) captivity brought
  me to 3443 AM, the first year of the reign of
  Evil-merodach, son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar
  (2 Kings 25:27, cp. 2 Kings 24:12, 15).
  Counting back from 3443 AM, 3418 was found
  to be Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year – the very
  year the Scriptures say he razed Jerusalem
  (Jer. 52:12–15). As stated above, this destruction
  took place in Zedekiah’s 11th year (2 Kings
  25:1–7), thus confirming the synchronization of
  Judah and Babylon in 3418. [@jones2019chronology, 309]
