# Jones's Chronology

Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones is a Southern Baptist minister and former geologist [@jones2021ministries].

The key assumptions of his chronology include:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system [@jones2019chronology, 130].
- A Nisan to Nisan year was used in Judah [@jones2019chronology, 118].

## Discussion

Concerning the Jeremiah 25:1 issue, Jones agrees with Tadmor:

> The Hebrew words for “first year” in Jer. 25:1
  are ** השנה הראשנית** (hashshanah haroshniyth).
  Not being found elsewhere in Scripture, the
  phrase is unique and the feminine singular
  form of the adjective modifying the word “year”
  can mean either “first or beginning”. Thus the
  phrase in Jer. 25:1 is seen as not referring to
  Nebuchadnezzar’s official first year but to his
  initial year on the throne, the year of his
  accession. [@jones2019chronology, 125]

Jones places Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Judah in the 3rd year of Jehoiakim as per Daniel 1:1.
However this would actually precede Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and fall in the 20th year of Nabopolasssar.

> It follows then that Daniel 1:1 does not conflict
  with Jeremiah 25:1 as is often claimed.
  Observe that Daniel 1:1 does not say that the
  third year of the reign of Jehoiakim is the first
  year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. As illustrated,
  such would be impossible from the data in
  chapter 1 when compared to 2:1 which is said to
  occur in Nebuchadnezzar’s second year of
  dominion. Moreover, Daniel 1:1 is merely a
  statement of identification, i.e., the Nebuchadnezzar
  who came and besieged Jerusalem in
  Jehoiakim’s third year is the same man who
  ascended to the throne and became sole rex the
  following year (Jer. 25:1). The apparent contradiction
  has been resolved by simply allowing
  the Scriptures to speak for themselves, apart
  from profane materials. [@jones2019chronology, 190] 

On the deportations at the end of Jeremiah, in the 7th and 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar:

> Yet, inconceivably,
  the later portion of Jeremiah 52 seems to record
  the fall of Jerusalem as having taken place in
  the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar rather than in
  his 19th (which was Zedekiah’s 11th).
  To begin with, these verses are not recorded in
  2 Kings 25. Jeremiah 52:28–34 seems to be an
  addendum – possibly written by Ezra in
  Babylon after Jeremiah’s death (It is noteworthy
  that it is not part of the text of the
  LXX.).<br>
  Being so small a number, most suppose verses
  28–30 are referring to only the adult males of
  importance. Yet, how can we conclude that only
  4,600 Jews were carried away in all of
  Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions when we know at
  least 10,000 of prominence were carried away at
  one time with Jeconiah in 597 BC (2 Kings
  24:12–16)?<br>
  Indeed, the very fact that 2 Kings 24:12–16
  records the removal of these 10,000 in the
  eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar demands that
  Jer. 52:28 where 3,023 were said to have been
  carried away in that monarch’s seventh year is
  referring to a completely separate event. The
  differing numbers should alert us that it is not
  merely a matter of attempting to reconcile
  Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh with his eighth year
  by “Hebrew reckoning” or “Babylonian reckoning”
  that is in view here. Two different happenings
  are before us.<br>
  It follows that if these are not equivalent, and
  thus should not be associated, then the same is
  true for trying to force the “18th year” of Jer.
  52:29 to match the “19th year” of Jer. 52:12 and
  2 Kings 25:8. Hence, it seems most reasonable
  to conclude with Ussher that there were three
  significant deportations – in 606 BC (when
  Nebuchadnezzar was general-of-the-army and
  crown prince, Dan.1:1), as well as his 8th, and
  19th regnal years — which are to be distinguished
  from the minor ones that Jer. 52:28–30
  lists in his 7th, 18th, and 23rd years.2 These
  latter, then, were likely added after the fact to
  complete the historical record.<br>
  If so, the first minor deportation, reported by
  Jeremiah to have transpired in Nebuchadnezzar’s
  7th year, would have been those seized by
  the bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, etc. whom the
  king of Babylon sent against Judah prior to his
  coming (2 Kings 24:2). That in the 18th year
  would correspond to when the Chaldeans broke
  off the siege of Jerusalem to meet Pharaoh’s
  approaching army. Afterward, it may have
  been deemed prudent to march the swelling
  number of Egyptian and Jewish prisoners in
  the camp off to Babylon. [@jones2019chronology, 127]

## Criticism

Against Jones' dating for Daniel 1:1 Ian Foley argues [@foley2014time, Chapter 2]:

> Jones (2004, 189) takes the view that the only possible solution to this first problem is that Nebuchadnezzar 
  must have besieged Jerusalem and Daniel must have been exiled in 606 BC. However, this solution creates as many 
  problems as it solves because (1) Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king in 606 BC. (However, he was crown prince, and 
  perhaps the title of "king" could be used), (2) Jones uses nonaccession year reckoning for the regnal years of 
  Nebuchadnezzar so that his second year is 604 BC, and it is not clear why he did not use accession year reckoning 
  to make Nebuchadnezzar's second year 603 BC. (3) Until the defeat of the Egyptians at the Battle of Carchemish 
  in 605 BC, there is strong evidence that Egypt controlled Judah and Palestine and that Nebuchadnezzar's expeditions 
  prior to that involved conflict with Egypt in Syria and further north, and (4) there are other solutions to the 
  two problems that would satisfy Jones's view of biblical inspiration without the need to 
  propose Daniel's exile in 606 BC.
