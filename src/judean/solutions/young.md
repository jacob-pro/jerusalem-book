# Young's Chronology

Rodger C. Young studies Old Testament Chronology [@young_testimony].

Young arrived at the following rules for interpreting Judean chronology [@young2004did, 37]:

- 2 Kings 24-25 uses Tishri years and non-accession reckoning for Judean kings.
- 2 Kings 24-25 uses Nisan years and non-accession reckoning for Nebuchadnezzar.
- Jeremiah (excluding chapter 52) uses Tishri years and non-accession years for Judah.
- Jeremiah (excluding chapter 52) uses non-accession years for Nebuchadnezzar (with either Nisan or Tishri years).
- Jeremiah 52:28-30 uses Nisan and accession year reckoning for Nebuchadnezzar [@young2004did, 36].
- Between 2 Kings 22:1 and 24:1 the counting system changed from accession to non-accession [@young2004did, 35].

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

Young claims that it was after Josiah's reign the Judean system changed to non-accession reckoning [@young2004did, 35]:

> The Babylonian Chronicles allow the date of his death to be calculated as the fourth month of 609 bc, which was in the
> year 610t. This was thirtyone years after the beginning of Josiah’s reign in 641t, so the reign length as given in 2
> Kgs 22:1 is by accession reckoning, showing, incidentally, that somewhere between 2 Kgs 22:1 and 24:1 the counting
> system changed from accession to non-accession.

### Battle of Carchemish

Regarding Carchemish [@young2004did, 36]:

> In Jer 46:2, the Battle of Carchemish is dated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, 609t – 3 (acc) = 606t. The battle
> occurred in 605n/605t, which is in the latter half of the year given by Jeremiah.

### Subjugation of Judah

Young does not appear to offer any explanation for when the subjugation of Judah took place (2 Kings 24:1, Daniel 1:1).

### Sieges of Jerusalem

Young's chronology would place Jehoiakim in his 12th year at the time of his death, he does not explain how this fits in
with 2 Kings 23:36.

Young reads the deportations in Jeremiah 52:28-30 as corresponding to the same years as the captives were taken in 2
Kings, however he does not appear to justify the difference in numbers [@young2004did, 36]:

> The writings of Jeremiah end with chapter 51 (Jer 51:64), so his methods of dating are not automatically applicable to
> the contents of chapter 52. The contents of that chapter, except for verses 28 through 30, are all parallel to
> passages in the last two chapters of 2 Kings, so the methods already determined for these chapters in 2 Kings (Tishri,
> non-accession reckoning) can be applied to the corresponding verses in Jeremiah 52. Verses 28 through 30 are
> independent of the Book of Kings and are interesting enough to require special consideration. <br><br> Jer 52:28–30
> gives the number of captives taken by Nebuchadnezzar in his seventh, eighteenth, and twenty-third years. There is one
> thing certain about the counting of captives—the captives themselves are in no position to do it. Every king and

### Release of Jehoiachin

Young counts the 37 years of Jehoiachin on a Tishri-to-Tishri calendar [@young2004did, 32]:

> The final synchronism in these chapters is 2 Kgs 25:27, which says that Jehoiachin, in the thirty-seventh year of his
> captivity, was released from prison by Evil-Merodach in the twelfth month of the year that he became king. The
> Babylonian Tablets establish this date as April 2, 561, shortly before Evil-Merodach’s first full year that began in
> Nisan of 561. The thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin’s exile was 598t – 36 (acc) = 562t, which is consistent with the
> date given in the Babylonian Tablets.
