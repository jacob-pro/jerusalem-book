# Tadmor's Chronology

Hayim Tadmor (1923-2006) was professor of Assyriology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem [@independent2006hayim].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@tadmor1956chronology, 226]:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system.
- A Nisan to Nisan year was used in Judah.

## Discussion

> Postulating a Nisan-to-Nisan year in
  Judah one has, consequently, 
  to equate the 4th year of Jehoiakim with the accession
  year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 25:1)
  rather than with the Babylonian king's
  first full year. The *hapax eiremenon* הראשנית השנה
  in Jer. 25:1 would refer therefore
  to the rēš šarrǔti (= accession year)
  of Nebuchadnezzar. [@tadmor1956chronology, 227]

Regarding Jehoiakim's 3 year vassalage:

> The three years of Jehoiakim's submission to
  Babylon before he rebelled would be then (Judean
  years): 604/3-602/1. The revolt in 601 might have
  been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt,
  whose new strength is evident from the defeat inflicted
  by Necho on the attacking armies of Babylon in that
  year. The account of Josephus (Ant. x, 87) of a new
  Babylonian campaign to Judah in Jehoiakim's 8th
  and Nebuchadnezzar's 4th year and the tribute paid
  to Babylon accords with the new Babylonian chronicle,
  which tells of a submission of Hatti prior to the
  battle with Egypt.

However no attempt at explaining Daniel 1:1 appears to have been made 
(with which it would contradict since it says Nebuchadnezzar seiged Jerusalem in the 3rd year of Jehoiakim).

Tadmor seems to believe the exiles (and Jehoiachin) were taken from Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah's accession did not begin until
the start of the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar, despite the fact that according to 
[BM 21946 Rev. 11-13](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.md) Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, took vast tribute and
appointed a new king at the end of his 7th year:

> The statements in Jer. 52:28 and 52:29 that
  3023 Judeans had been exiled in the 7th and 18th (instead
  of the correct 8th and 19th) years of Nebuchadnezzar
  seem to derive from the same tradition, but no
  satisfactory explanation of its origin has yet been
  offered. [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]

Regarding the release of Jehoiachin in the accession year of Amel-Marduk:

> Actually it was four or two days less than 37 full
  years, so that the Judean king was released on the eve
  of the New Year festival, when Amel-Marduk was to
  be formally enthroned. [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]
