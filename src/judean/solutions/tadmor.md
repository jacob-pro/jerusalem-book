# Tadmor's Chronology

Hayim Tadmor (1923-2006) was professor of Assyriology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem [@independent2006hayim].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@tadmor1956chronology, 226]:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system.
- A Nisan to Nisan year was used in Judah.

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

Tadmor dates the battle of Megiddo between month III and IV, just prior to Egyptian army's arrival at Harran in month IV
[@tadmor1956chronology, 228]:

> It was sometime in Sivan/Tammuz 609 that the "great Egyptian Army" (B.M. 21901, rev. 1. 66), setting out to rescue
> Assurubalit II in Harran, encountered Josiah in Megiddo, defeated him and proceeded to the North.

### Battle of Carchemish

Tadmor interprets Jeremiah 25:1 as referring to Nebuchadnezzar's accession year rather than 1st year
[@tadmor1956chronology, 227]:

> Postulating a Nisan-to-Nisan year in Judah one has, consequently, to equate the 4th year of Jehoiakim with the
> accession year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 25:1) rather than with the Babylonian king's first full year. The _hapax
> eiremenon_ הראשנית השנה in Jer. 25:1 would refer therefore to the rēš šarrǔti (= accession year) of Nebuchadnezzar.

### Subjugation of Judah

Tadmor dates subjugation of Judah to Nebuchadnezzar's 1st year or Jehoiakim's 5th year [@tadmor1956chronology, 229]:

> The three years of Jehoiakim's submission to Babylon before he rebelled would be then (Judean years): 604/3-602/1. The
> revolt in 601 might have been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt, whose new strength is evident from the
> defeat inflicted by Necho on the attacking armies of Babylon in that year. The account of Josephus (Ant. x, 87) of a
> new Babylonian campaign to Judah in Jehoiakim's 8th and Nebuchadnezzar's 4th year and the tribute paid to Babylon
> accords with the new Babylonian chronicle, which tells of a submission of Hatti prior to the battle with Egypt.

He doesn't attempt to reconcile this date (the 5th year of Jehoiakim) with Daniel 1:1.

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

Tadmor's synchronistic table lists the siege of Jerusalem and capture of Jehoiachin as 2/XII of Nebuchadnezzar's 7th
year, based on [BM 21946](../../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md) Rev. 11-13. But he claims that the exile of captives,
and Zedekiah's accession did not actually take place until the beginning of the new year (Nisan, Nebuchadnezzar year 8)
— which would match 2 Kings 24:12, and 2 Chronicles 36:10.

He is not however able to explain the difference in the number of captives in Jeremiah 52 [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]:

> The statements in Jer. 52:28 and 52:29 that 3023 Judeans had been exiled in the 7th and 18th (instead of the correct
> 8th and 19th) years of Nebuchadnezzar seem to derive from the same tradition, but no satisfactory explanation of its
> origin has yet been offered.

Regarding Jehoiachin's release Tadmor says [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]:

> Actually it was four or two days less than 37 full years, so that the Judean king was released on the eve of the New
> Year festival, when Amel-Marduk was to be formally enthroned.
