# Tadmor's Chronology

Hayim Tadmor (1923-2006) was professor of Assyriology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem [@independent2006hayim].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@tadmor1956chronology, 226]:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system.
- A Nisan to Nisan year was used in Judah.

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

> It was sometime in Sivan/Tammuz 609 that the "great Egyptian Army" (B.M. 21901, rev. 1. 66), setting out to rescue
> Assurubalit II in Harran, encountered Josiah in Megiddo, defeated him and proceeded to the North.
> [@tadmor1956chronology, 228]

### Battle of Carchemish

> Postulating a Nisan-to-Nisan year in Judah one has, consequently, to equate the 4th year of Jehoiakim with the
> accession year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 25:1) rather than with the Babylonian king's first full year. The _hapax
> eiremenon_ הראשנית השנה in Jer. 25:1 would refer therefore to the rēš šarrǔti (= accession year) of Nebuchadnezzar.
> [@tadmor1956chronology, 227]

### Subjugation of Judah

> The three years of Jehoiakim's submission to Babylon before he rebelled would be then (Judean years): 604/3-602/1. The
> revolt in 601 might have been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt, whose new strength is evident from the
> defeat inflicted by Necho on the attacking armies of Babylon in that year. The account of Josephus (Ant. x, 87) of a
> new Babylonian campaign to Judah in Jehoiakim's 8th and Nebuchadnezzar's 4th year and the tribute paid to Babylon
> accords with the new Babylonian chronicle, which tells of a submission of Hatti prior to the battle with Egypt.
> [@tadmor1956chronology, 229]

However no attempt at reconciling Daniel 1:1 appears to have been made (with which it would contradict since it says
Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem in the 3rd year rather than 5th of Jehoiakim).

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

Tadmor's synchronistic table lists the siege of Jerusalem and capture of Jehoiachin as 2/XII of Nebuchadnezzar's 7th
year, based on [BM 21946](../../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md) Rev. 11-13. But he notes that the captives were taken,
and that Zedekiah's accession were at the beginning in the new year (Nisan, Nebuchadnezzar year 8) - which would match 2
Kings 24:12, and 2 Chronicles 36:10.

> The statements in Jer. 52:28 and 52:29 that 3023 Judeans had been exiled in the 7th and 18th (instead of the correct
> 8th and 19th) years of Nebuchadnezzar seem to derive from the same tradition, but no satisfactory explanation of its
> origin has yet been offered. [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]

### Release of Jehoiachin

> Actually it was four or two days less than 37 full years, so that the Judean king was released on the eve of the New
> Year festival, when Amel-Marduk was to be formally enthroned. [@tadmor1956chronology, 230]
