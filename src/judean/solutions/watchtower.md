<sup>1</sup> As explained in the [Watchtower Chronology](../../watchtower/README.md) chapter the Watchtower uses a
different method for determining the destruction of Jerusalem and reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the first year listed
is that used by the Watchtower, and the second would be the equivalent under the orthodox Babylonian chronology allowing
easy comparison to the other chronologies in the section.

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

> Toward the close of Josiah’s 31-year reign (659-629 B.C.E.), Pharaoh Necho led his army northward to the aid of the 
  Assyrians. For a reason not revealed in the Bible, King Josiah disregarded “the words of Necho from the mouth of God” 
  and tried to turn the Egyptian forces back at Megiddo, but he was mortally wounded in the attempt. He was brought 
  back to Jerusalem in a war chariot and died either en route or upon arrival there. [@watch2018insight2, 118]

> After the death of good King Josiah in 628 B.C.E., his three sons and a grandson proved to be bad in their dealings. 
  [@watch1979royal, 25]
  
> Jehoahaz was 23 years old when made king, and he ruled badly for three months in the early part of the year 
  628 B.C.E., until he was imprisoned at Riblah by Pharaoh. Later he was taken to Egypt, where he died in captivity, 
  just as the prophet Jeremiah had foretold.—2Ki 23:31-34; Jer 22:10-12. [@watch2018insight1, 1265]

> Three months later (in 628 B.C.E.) Nechoh removed Josiah’s son and successor Jehoahaz from the Judean throne and 
  replaced him with his brother Eliakim (renamed Jehoiakim), carrying Jehoahaz captive to Egypt. 
  (2Ki 23:31-35; 2Ch 36:1-4; compare Eze 19:1-4.)  [@watch2018insight1, 698]

There appears to be a problem here - according to [BM 21901](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.md) Line 66 the
Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates to help the king of Assyria in Tammuz (the 4th month). Therefore Josiah
must have died prior to this when he intercepted Necho at Megiddo - about 500 km before the river, likely around the
3rd month (May 629/609) [@tadmor1956chronology, 228] [@malamat1967last, 139] [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 31] 
[@clines1972regnal, 29] [@horn1967babylonian, 17] [@hyatt1966beginning, 208]. 

However the Watchtower chronology requires that Josiah died at the start of 628/608, 
such that following Jehoahaz's rule of 3 months the 1st year of Jehoiakim would begin shortly after Nisan 1
(March/April) 628. The actual death of Josiah in May 629/609 as indicated by the chronicle would require either
moving Jehoiakim's reign a year earlier - which would cause serious issues (Jeremiah 25:1, 46:2, 2 Kings 23:36),
or that there was an unexplained interregnum of at least 6 months between Josiah and Jehoahaz.

In contradiction with their own chronology, the Watchtower has acknowledged and agreed with the 
interpretation of the chronicle:

> This chronicle states, under the 17th year of Nabopolassar (629 B.C.E.): “In the month Duʼuzu, Ashur-uballit, 
  king of Assyria, (and) a large \[army of\] E\[gy\]pt \[who had come to his aid\] crossed the river (Euphrates) and 
  \[marched on\] to conquer Harran.” (Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p.305; brackets and parentheses theirs.) 
  Actually, Ashur-uballit was trying to reconquer it after having been driven out. This record is in harmony with the 
  account relative to the activity of Pharaoh Nechoh recorded at 2 Kings 23:29, which activity resulted in the 
  death of King Josiah of Judah (c. 629 B.C.E.). This text states that “Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt 
  came up to the king of Assyria by the river Euphrates”—evidently to help him. “The king of Assyria” to whom 
  Nechoh came may well have been Ashur-uballit II. Their campaign against Haran did not succeed. The Assyrian Empire
  had ended. [@watch2018insight1, 205]

### Battle of Carchemish

> The fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim
  (625 B.C.E.) saw Nebuchadnezzar defeat Pharaoh
  Necho in a battle over the domination of Syria-
  Palestine. The battle took place at Carchemish by
  the Euphrates, over 600 km (370 mi) N of Jerusalem.
  (Jer 46:1, 2) [@watch2018insight1, 1268]

> In 625 B.C.E. a decisive
  battle was fought at Carchemish between
  the Egyptian and Babylonian armies. Nebuchadnezzar
  led the Babylonians to a smashing victory
  over Pharaoh Necho’s forces and swept over Syria
  and Canaan. This battle marked the end of Egyptian
  imperial strength in these regions. The Bible
  account at Jeremiah 46:2 is paralleled by that of
  the Babylonian Chronicles (B.M. 21946), both describing
  the defeat of the Egyptian army.  [@watch2018insight1, 418]

> During the 21st year
  of Nabopolassar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar marched
  with the Babylonian army to Carchemish, there to
  fight against the Egyptians. He led his forces to
  victory. This took place in the fourth year of Judean
  King Jehoiakim (625 B.C.E.).—Jer 46:2. [@watch2018insight2, 480]

### Capture of Jehoiachin

> Later, the rebellion
  of Judean King Jehoiakim against Nebuchadnezzar
  evidently resulted in a siege being laid against
  Jerusalem by the Babylonians. It appears that during
  this siege Jehoiakim died and his son Jehoiachin
  ascended the throne of Judah. But a mere
  three months and ten days thereafter the reign
  of the new king ended when Jehoiachin surrendered
  to Nebuchadnezzar (in the month of Adar
  \[February-March\] during Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh
  regnal year \[ending in Nisan 617 B.C.E.\], according
  to the Babylonian Chronicles). [@watch2018insight2, 480]

> The Bible record is quite detailed in its account of the first punitive expedition against the kingdom of Judah by 
  Nebuchadnezzar (or Nebuchadrezzar) in his seventh regnal year (or eighth year from his accession to the throne). 
  (Jer. 52:28; 2 Ki. 24:12) [@watch1969babylonian]

On the difference in the numbers of captives between 2 Kings and Jeremiah 52:

> But it was more than a decade later, in
  617 B.C.E., that the first captives from Jerusalem
  were taken into exile at Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar
  came against the rebellious city and carried
  off the upper class of the population, including
  King Jehoiachin and his mother, and men such as
  Ezekiel, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
  together with “the princes and all the valiant,
  mighty men—ten thousand he was taking into
  exile—and also every craftsman and builder of
  bulwarks. No one had been left behind except the
  lowly class of the people . . . Court officials and the
  foremost men of the land he led away as exiled
  people from Jerusalem to Babylon. As for all the
  valiant men, seven thousand, and the craftsmen
  and the builders of bulwarks, a thousand, all the
  mighty men carrying on war, the king of Babylon
  proceeded to bring them as exiled people to Babylon.”
  He also took much of the treasure from the
  temple. (2Ki 24:12-16; Es 2:6; Eze 1:1-3; Da 1:2, 6)
  Jehoiachin’s uncle Zedekiah was left behind as a
  vassal king. A few others of note, including the
  prophet Jeremiah, also remained in Jerusalem. In
  view of the large number of captives recorded at
  2 Kings 24:14, the figure 3,023 given at Jeremiah
  52:28 apparently refers to those of a certain rank,
  or to those who were family heads—their wives
  and children, numbering thousands, not being included
  in the figure. [@watch2018insight1, 415]

Against the idea that Jeremiah 52:28 only refers to the adult males Green says:

> Bright's theory that the 3,023 in Jeremiah refer only to adult males
  does not narrow the gap because all the classification listed in Kings are
  certainly men. [@green1982chronology, 64]

### Capture of Zedekiah

> Sometime later Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar,
  allying himself with Egypt for military
  protection. (Eze 17:15; compare Jer 27:11-14.)
  This brought the Babylonians back to Jerusalem,
  and on Tebeth (December-January) 10 in the
  ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar
  besieged Jerusalem. (2Ki 24:20; 25:1; 2Ch 36:
  13\) However, news that a military force of Pharaoh
  was coming out of Egypt caused the Babylonians
  to lift the siege temporarily. (Jer 37:5)
  Subsequently Pharaoh’s troops were forced to go
  back to Egypt, and the Babylonians resumed the
  siege against Jerusalem. (Jer 37:7-10) Finally,
  in 607 B.C.E., on Tammuz (June-July) 9 in the
  11th year of Zedekiah’s reign (Nebuchadnezzar’s
  19th year if counting from his accession year or
  his 18th regnal year), a breach was made in Jerusalem’s
  wall. [@watch2018insight2, 481]

And again on the number of exiles:

> Zedekiah’s
  sons, the princes of Judah, court officials, certain
  priests, and many other prominent citizens were
  put to death at the order of the king of Babylon.
  (2Ki 25:7, 18-21; Jer 52:10, 24-27) All of this could
  account for the rather low number of those actually
  listed as exiles that were led off, the number
  given being only 832, probably heads of households,
  their wives and children not being counted.
  —Jer 52:29. [@watch2018insight1, 416]

### Release of Jehoiachin

> Second ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire; son of Nabopolassar and father of Awil-Marduk (Evil-merodach), 
  who succeeded him to the throne. Nebuchadnezzar ruled as king for 43 years (624-582 B.C.E.) [@watch2018insight2, 480]

> The Babylonian king who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar to the throne in 581 B.C.E. In the year of his becoming king, 
  Evil-merodach extended kindness to Jehoiachin the king of Judah by releasing him from the house of detention. 
  That was in the 37th year of Jehoiachin’s exile in Babylon. [@watch2018insight1, 773]

> In the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, Ezekiel
  began his prophetic work. (Eze 1:2) About 32
  years later, evidently in 580 B.C.E., Jehoiachin
  was released from prison by Nebuchadnezzar’s
  successor Evil-merodach (Awil-Marduk) and given
  a position of favor above all the other captive
  kings. Thereafter he ate at Evil-merodach’s table
  and received a daily allowance.—2Ki 25:27-30;
  Jer 52:31-34. [@watch2018insight1, 1267]

The Insight book appears to imply there was a gap of up to one year between the death of Nebuchadnezzar in his 
43rd year (the year spanning 582-581), and the accession of Evil-Merodach (Amel-Marduk) in the year spanning (581-580). 
This would be consistent with the arguments made in the Watchtower 2011:

> For example, the documents show that Nebuchadnezzar II was still ruling in his tenth month—six months after his 
  successor is assumed to have begun reigning. <br><br>
  Could others have ruled between the reigns of these kings? If so, additional years would have to be added 
  to the Neo-Babylonian period. [@watch2011when2]
