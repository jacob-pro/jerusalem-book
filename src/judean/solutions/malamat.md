# Malamat's Chronology

Abraham Malamat (1922–2010) was a professor of Jewish history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
[@willette2010malamat].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@malamat1975twilight, 124]:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system.
- A Tishri-to-Tishri year was used for regnal years in Judah (although the months of the year are still counted from
  Nisan).

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

Malamat argues that the battle of Megiddo took place in month III, just before the attack on Harran [@malamat1967last,
139] [@malamat1975twilight, 125]:

> Josiah evidently died in Sivan or possibly at the start of Tammuz, as indicated by correlating the biblical account (2
> Kings 23:29; 2 Chron. 35:20-23) with that of the Babylonian Chronicle of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar. The
> Bible relates that Necho, when intercepted by Josiah at Megiddo, was in great haste northward ('for God commanded me
> to make haste'; 2 Chron. 35:21), while the Babylonian source records that 'a large Egyptian army', on its way to aid
> the allied Assyrians against the Babylonian forces, had already crossed the Euphrates in Tammuz. Assuming that the
> Egyptian army marched at the considerable rate of 35 km a day, or even more (remembering that this took place during
> the long summer days), it could have covered the distance between Megiddo and Carchemish (over 500 km) in about two
> weeks. Thus, the Battle of Megiddo probably occurred sometime between early Sivan and early Tammuz.

> But note now that the Egyptians required almost a month, rather than two weeks, to cover the distance to the river
> (which they crossed in Tammuz 609 B.C.), for the actual distance between Megiddo and Carchemish is about 650 km, and
> the advance of the rushing Egyptian army should be estimated at about 25-30 km per diem.

The length of the march, and therefore timing of the battle of Megiddo is significant because it has an impact on the
likelihood of a Tishri-to-Tishri year in Judah, as explained by Clines [@clines1972regnal, 29]:

> In determining the date of his \[Jehoiakim's\] accession, the events which must be brought into relationship are:
> <br>1. Battle of Megiddo, death of Josiah, accession of Jehoahaz. <br>2. March of Egyptians from Megiddo to Euphrates.
> <br>3. Egyptian crossing of Euphrates for attack on Harran. <br>4. Capture of Jehoahaz and accession of Jehoiakim.

> The chronological data are twofold: <br>a. No. 3 occurred in Tammuz (25 June-23 July), 609 (BM 21901, Rev. 66-67).
> <br>b. 'Three months' intervened between No. 1 and No. 4 (2 Kings 23:31; 2 Chr. 36:2).

Clines argues against Malamat's scheme for Jehoiakim's reign, claiming it was more likely that Josiah's death, Jehoahaz'
3 months rule, and Jehoiakim's accession all occurred before Tishri, rather than after it [@clines1972regnal, 32].

### Battle of Carchemish

In Malamat's chronology the battle of Carchemish took place in Jehoiakim's 3rd year, rather than his 4th as described in
Jeremiah 46:2 [@malamat1975twilight, 127]:

> On the Babylonian source, see _CCK_, pp. 66ff. (BM 21946). Jer. 46:2 places the Battle of Carchemish in Jehoiakim's
> fourth regnal year, the only substantial instance of a date conflicting with our Tishri reckoning, which would put
> this battle in his third year (cf. the Chronological Table). See _IEJ_ XVIII 1968, p. 147, n. 21, where we have also
> cited HORN's suggestion to reconcile the difficulty here by attributing this date to the time of the oracular
> utterance rather than to the battle itself. Although problematic, this might find support in Jer. 36:1-2, where the
> date of the Prophet's first scroll, which recorded _inter alia_ Oracles on the Nations, is fixed in Jehoiakim's fourth
> regnal year. The chronological notation at the head of the Oracles on the Nations in Jer. 46:2 thus may well have been
> harmonized with this. WEIPPERT (_Edom_, p. 653, n. 1238) assumes that the Battle of Carchemish and the subsequent
> Babylonian campaign, which latter took place in the winter of 605/604 B.C., after the enthronement of Nebuchadnezzar.
> were regarded in Judah as one continuous military episode, which thus would have fallen already in Jehoiakim's fourth
> regnal year; but Jeremiah's prophecy specifically deals with the defeat of "the army of Pharaoh Necho" which no longer
> took part in events half a year after the Battle of Carchemish.

### Subjugation of Judah

Malamat does not offer a definitive date for Nebuchadnezzar's subjugation of Judah, but offers a number of suggestions
[@malamat1975twilight, 129]:

> The Babylonian subjugation of Judah was not long in coming. The exact date is still a matter of controversy, and even
> Nebuchadnezzar's Chronicle is indefinite. Military campaigns to the West are recorded for each of the years between
> 605 and 601 B.C., but no specific names of subjected states are mentioned (except Ashkelon).

The first proposal, corresponding to [BM 21946, Obv. 8](../../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md) matches the 3rd year of
Jehoiakim in Daniel 1:1 [@malamat1975twilight, 129]:

> a\) Judah was conquered immediately after the Egypdan defeat at the Battle of Carchemish. This is supported by the
> opening of the Book of Daniel (1:1-4) relating the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in the third year of Jehoiakim
> (see Chronological Table), the looting of "vessels of the house of God", and the exiling of certain Judeans. Further
> the last datum is in accord with a tradition related by Josephus (_Ant_. X; 11, 1; _Contra Apionem_ I, 19), that
> Judean captives; amongst others, were carried off to Babylon after the victory at Carchemish. In another passage (Ant.
> X, 6, 1), Josephus even specifies that at this same time Nebuchadnezzar conquered all the lands of the West as far as
> Pelusium on the border of Egypt—but he explicitely adds: "except the land of Judah"; It is difficult, however, to rely
> upon the chronological accuracy of these traditions (which apparently refer to events occurring several years later).
> Though Josephus's data largely agree with those of the Babylonian Chronicle, the Chronicle itself does not bear out
> any widespread conquests in the West while Nebuchadnezzar was still Crown Prince. Immediately after the victory at
> Carchemish, as we now know, Nebuchadnezzar conquered only the "entire land of Ha\[ma\]th", and not the "entire land of
> Hatti" (that is, Syria-Palestine), as formerly read.

#### Issues

Nebuchadnezzar did not become king until later in that year, so Daniel 1:1 would have to be read proleptically as
suggested by Mercer [@mercer1989daniel, 183] and Clines [@clines1972regnal, 23].

Clines questions whether there was enough time between the battle of Carchemish and Nebuchadnezzar's return to Babylon
following Nabopolassar's death for this to be possible [@clines1972regnal, 24] [@mercer1989daniel, 187]:

> It involves the interposition of a Babylonian march to Jerusalem from Hamath (no place further south is mentioned in
> the Babylonian Chronicle) and a siege of the city in the short interval between May-June (Carchemish) and c. August 25
> (news of Nabopolassar's death). Very little time, if any, would be available for the siege itself, when the days spent
> in marching are reckoned up (see below, under II.2). We do not know where Nebuchadrezzar was when he received news of
> his father's death, but it must be recalled that only 3 weeks elapsed between Nabopolassar's death and
> Nebuchadrazzar's arrival in Babylon.

#### Alternatives

Alternatively Malamat suggests the 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Obv. 15-17) [@malamat1975twilight, 130]:

> b\) Judah submitted a year later, when Nebuchadnezzar devastated Ashkelon, in Kislev of his first regnal year
> (December 604 B.C.). This date corresponds exactly with the ninth month of the fifth regnal year of Jehoiakim, when a
> general day of fasting was proclaimed in Jerusalem (Jer. 36:9 ff.; see the Chronological Table). Jeremiah's foreboding
> words, brought before an emergency council of ministers on the fastday, warned of the impending national calamity— the

These would be in the 5th or 6th year of Jehoiakim [@malamat1967last, 142]:

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

Malamat attempts to reconcile the differing dates and numbers of exiles between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25, by
treating them as separate events [@malamat1975twilight, 133]:

> The biblical sources on the exile of Jehoiachin are in outward contradiction, in both the extent of the exile and its
> exact date. According to II Kings 24, the exile encompassed 10,000 (_vs_. 14) or 7,000 (_vs_. 16) persons, mostly
> military, to either of which we must add a thousand armourers and sappers. This mass exile, headed by Jehoiachin and
> his entourage, occurred according to this source in the eight year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (_vs_. 12), the year
> beginning on 1 Nisan 597 B.C.—at least a month after the surrender of Jerusalem. Moreover, II Chronicles 34:10 also
> implies that Jehoiachin was exiled around the time of the civil new year, and that Nebuchadnezzar had already returned
> to his capital, surely for the annual festivities. But according to the list of exiles in Jeremiah 52 (based
> undoubtedly on some official source), a mere 3,023 "Jews" were exiled—in the _seventh_ year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign
> (_vs_ 28). These have generally been regarded as contradicting traditions on one and the same matter, or it has been
> thought that different chronological systems were employed in the Book of Kings and in Jeremiah 52, respectively
> —though even then the numbers for the deportees disagree. The discrepancies between the two sources can be reconciled,
> however, by proposing that the exile evolved in two successive deportations: <br><br> a\) The first phase (already
> intimated in Jer. 13:18-19) was a limited deportation prior to or upon the surrender of Jerusalem —still in
> Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year (Jer. 52:28). The particular appellative here, "Jews"—implying the provincial element of
> Judah—is brought into perspective by the designation "from Jerusalem", applied to the exiles deported during the final
> siege, in Nebuchadnezzar's 18th year (_vs_. 29; and see the Chronological Table). Several years after the destruction
> of Jerusalem, in Nebuchadnezzar's 23rd year, the deportees are once again, and quite appropriately, called "Jews"
> (_vs_. 30). <br><br> b\) The second, principal phase of the exile, described in the Book of Kings, comprised the cream
> of Jerusalem and thousands of her defenders, including the armourers and sappers specifically mentioned as exiled from
> the capital (Jer. 24:1; 29:2). The organization of this mass exile surely necessitated several weeks from the time of
> the surrender of the city, on 2 Adar, and thus it would have fallen only in Nebuchadnezzar's eighth regnal year, by
> which time he had already left the country.
