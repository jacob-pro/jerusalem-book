# Malamat's Chronology

Abraham Malamat (1922â€“2010) was a professor of Jewish history at the Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem [@willette2010malamat].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@malamat1975twilight, 124]:

- The Judean kings are reckoned on an accession year system.
- A Tishri to Tishri year was used for regnal years in Judah 
  (although the months of the year are still counted on the civil calendar (Nisan)).

### Megiddo

According to [BM 21901](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.md) line 66, the Egyptian army crossed the river 
Euphrates in Tammuz (IV) of Nabopolassar's 17th year. Malamat therefore argues that the battle of
Megiddo took place in Sivan (III):

> Josiah evidently died in Sivan or possibly at the start of Tammuz, as indicated by correlating the biblical account 
  (2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chron. 35:20-23) with that of the Babylonian Chronicle of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar. 
  The Bible relates that Necho, when intercepted by Josiah at Megiddo, was in great haste northward 
  ('for God commanded me to make haste'; 2 Chron. 35:21), while the Babylonian source records that 
  'a large Egyptian army', on its way to aid the allied Assyrians against the Babylonian forces, had already 
  crossed the Euphrates in Tammuz. Assuming that the Egyptian army marched at the considerable rate of 35 km a day, 
  or even more (remembering that this took place during the long summer days), it could have covered the distance 
  between Megiddo and Carchemish (over 500 km) in about two weeks. Thus, the Battle of Megiddo probably occurred 
  sometime between early Sivan and early Tammuz. [@malamat1967last, 139]

> But note now that the Egyptians required almost
  a month, rather than two weeks, to cover the distance to the river (which they
  crossed in Tammuz 609 B.C.), for the actual distance between Megiddo and
  Carchemish is about 650 km, and the advance of the rushing Egyptian army
  should be estimated at about 25-30 km per diem. [@malamat1975twilight, 125]

The length of the march, and therefore timing of the battle of Megiddo is significant because it has an 
impact on the likelihood of a Tishri to Tishri
year in Judah, as explained by Clines [@clines1972regnal, 29]:

> In determining the date of his \[Jehoiakim's\] accession, the events which
  must be brought into relationship are:
  <br>1. Battle of Megiddo, death of Josiah, accession of Jehoahaz.
  <br>2. March of Egyptians from Megiddo to Euphrates.
  <br>3. Egyptian crossing of Euphrates for attack on Harran.
  <br>4. Capture of Jehoahaz and accession of Jehoiakim.

> The chronological data are twofold:
  <br>a. No. 3 occurred in Tammuz (25 June-23 July), 609 (BM 21901, Rev. 66-67).
  <br>b. 'Three months' intervened between No. 1 and No. 4 (2 Kings 23:31; 2 Chr. 36:2).

However Clines believes it is more likely that Josiah died, Jehoahaz ruled for 3 months, and then Jehoiakim acceded to 
the throne before Tishri 1, rather than after it, and as such this would move his accession year back by one.
If this were the case it would cause a conflict since Jehoiakim would have died in his 12th rather than 11th year
as described in 2 Kings 23:36 and 2 Chronicles 36:5. [@clines1972regnal, 32]
