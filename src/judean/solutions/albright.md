> W. F. Albright, who holds 
  that in the west Nebuchadnezzar's official accession year
  (605/604) was considered his first regnal year, and that all data
  pertaining to Nebuchadnezzar given in Biblical records (with
  the exception of a passage in Jer 52:28-30) were one year
  higher than the Babylonian numbering, and thus differed
  by one year from the official Babylonian reckoning. This
  theory can hardly be correct, because it would seem strange
  indeed that the Jewish annalists should have used for Nebuchadnezzar
  the antedating (or non-accession-year) system,
  while they used the postdating (accession-year) system for
  their own kings. That the Babylonians used the postdating
  system is well known and needs no demonstration, and all
  scholars agree that this system was also used by the Jewish
  writers with regard to the regnal years of their own kings.
  Should it therefore not be more plausible to assume that the
  Jewish historians used the postdating system consistently in
  their records for the kings of Babylonia as well as for their
  own kings? [@horn1967babylonian, 23]
