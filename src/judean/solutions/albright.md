# Albright's Chronology

William Foxwell Albright (1891-1971) was a biblical archaeologist and Middle Eastern scholar [@britannica2021albright].

The key assumptions of his chronology include [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 32]:

- A Nisan-to-Nisan calendar was used for regnal years in Judah.
- Jeremiah (except 52:28-30) starts Nebuchadnezzar's reign one year earlier, using the "Western calculation".

## Discussion

### Battle of Megiddo

Albright dates the death of Josiah at Megiddo to Spring of Nabopolassar's 17th year, just prior to the Egyptian attack
on Harran in month IV.

> First, I see no escape from dating the Battle of Megiddo in
  the spring of 609, since there was a massive Egyptian attack on Harran
  later that summer, whereas not a word is said about Egyptian military
  movements in 608. [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 31]

### Battle of Carchemish

Jeremiah 46:2 "Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar 
king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim" would now make sense since while it actually took place while
Nebuchadnezzar was crown prince, he was considered in the West as king a year earlier.

Jeremiah 25:1 "the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar"
would therefore refer actually to Nebuchadnezzar's accession year.

### Subjugation of Judah

Albright seems to think that Judah was not occupied until after the capture of Ashkelon
([BM 21946](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.md) Obv. 18), perhaps in the 2nd year of Nebuchadnezzar:

> It is most unlikely that
  the Chaldaeans occupied Judah before the capture and destruction of
  Ascalon in December, 604, and since the next two years were apparently
  devoted to continued fighting in Greater Syria, I should consider it
  unlikely that Judah was actually invaded until some time in 603/2. [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 31]

This doesn't explain Obv. 17 where `All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their vast tribute.`
in the first year, or how Daniel 1:1 would fit in here (it would be the 6th year of Jehoiakim).

### Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah

> As a result of the new Chronicle I have slightly changed my own interpretation
  of the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar given throughout Jeremiah
  except in the passage 52:28-30, which does not appear at all in
  the Western recension and was, therefore, probably inserted later in
  Babylonia. The Jeremianic regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar are all one
  year too high, from the Babylonian point of view: the Battle of Carchemish
  was actually fought while he was still crown prince, and the two
  falls of Jerusalem were in his seventh and eighteenth years, not in the
  eighth and nineteenth. This is correctly stated in the interpolated passage
  which we have mentioned. It is well known that there was a
  difference of a year in two methods of reckoning the reign of Sennacherib,
  so I propose that we assume the same to have happened in
  reckoning the years of Nebuchadnezzar. In the West the latter had
  been king *de facto* since he took command of the army in the last months
  of 606/5, after his father had returned in Shebat (roughly February) to
  Babylonia. During the whole of the following spring and summer, until
  his father's death, Nebuchadnezzar was in sole command of the army in
  the field, as far as we know. Under such circumstances it would scarcely
  be remarkable if his western subordinates began to reckon his regnal
  years in 605/4 instead of a year later. The chronology of Jeremiah
  would then be the normal Western calculation, and not a specifically
  Jewish way of counting years. [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar, 32]

However this does not seem to explain Jeremiah 32:1 "the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, 
which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.", since if Jeremiah is consistently using the "Western calculation" then
it should actually say the seventeenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

He also does not appear to explain the difference in the number of exiles between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25.

### Criticism

> W. F. Albright, who holds 
  that in the west Nebuchadnezzar's official accession year
  (605/604) was considered his first regnal year, and that all data
  pertaining to Nebuchadnezzar given in Biblical records (with
  the exception of a passage in Jer 52:28-30) were one year
  higher than the Babylonian numbering, and thus differed
  by one year from the official Babylonian reckoning. This
  theory can hardly be correct, because it would seem strange
  indeed that the Jewish annalists should have used for Nebuchadnezzar
  the antedating (or non-accession-year) system,
  while they used the postdating (accession-year) system for
  their own kings. That the Babylonians used the postdating
  system is well known and needs no demonstration, and all
  scholars agree that this system was also used by the Jewish
  writers with regard to the regnal years of their own kings.
  Should it therefore not be more plausible to assume that the
  Jewish historians used the postdating system consistently in
  their records for the kings of Babylonia as well as for their
  own kings? [@horn1967babylonian, 23]
