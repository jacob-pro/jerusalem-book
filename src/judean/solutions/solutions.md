# Solutions to the Judean Chronology

A number of authors have proposed different solutions for interpreting and synchronising the chronological data, and as
a result come to different dates for the destruction of Jerusalem, including:

| Author              | Publication                                                                                     | Year on Babylonian Calendar | Year BC |

| Abraham Malamat     | The twilight of Judah: in the Egyptian-Babylonian maelstrom [@malamat1975twilight]              | 19                          | 586     |

| John P. Hyatt       | New Light on Nebuchadrezzar and Judean History [@hyatt1956new]                                  | 18                          | 587     |
| Roger C. Young      | When Did Jerusalem Fall? [@young2004did]                                                        | 18                          | 587     |
| Watch Tower Society | Insight on the Scriptures [@watch2018insight1] [@watch2018insight2]                             | 18                          | 607\*   |

\* While the Watch Tower claims Jerusalem was captured in Nebuchadnezzar's 18th regnal year [@watch2018insight2, 481],
they reject the standard chronology for Babylonia.

We will see that all the proposed solutions fail to definitively satisfy all the chronological data, which explains why
there is no consensus among historians on a certain date for the destruction of Jerusalem. As summarised by Horn
[@horn1967babylonian, 16]:

> no definite and unassailable conclusions can be reached until a historical record dealing with that event is found
