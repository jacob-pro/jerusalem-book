# Solutions to the Judean Chronology

A number of authors have proposed different solutions for interpreting and synchronising
the chronological data, and as a result come to different dates for the destruction of Jerusalem, including:

| Author              | Publication                                                                                     | Year on Babylonian Calendar | Year BC |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| Hayim Tadmor        | Chronology of the Last Kings of Judah [@tadmor1956chronology]                                   | 19                          | 586     |
| Floyd N. Jones      | Chronology of the Old Testament [@jones2019chronology]                                          | 19                          | 586     |
| Abraham Malamat     | The twilight of Judah: in the Egyptian-Babylonian maelstrom [@malamat1975twilight]              | 19                          | 586     |
| Edwin R. Thiele     | The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (New Revised Edition) [@thiele1983mysterious]        | 19                          | 586     |
| Siegfried H. Horn   | The Babylonian Chronicle and the Ancient Calendar of the Kingdom of Judah [@horn1967babylonian] | 19                          | 586     |
| William F. Albright | The Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar Chronicles [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar]                     | 18                          | 587     |
| Roger C. Young      | When Did Jerusalem Fall? [@young2004did]                                                        | 18                          | 587     |
| Watchtower Society  | Insight on the Scriptures                                                                       | 18                          | 607(!)  |

We will see that all of the proposed solutions fail to definitively satisfy all the chronological data, and therefore 
we are unable to give a certain date for the destruction of Jerusalem:

> no definite and unassailable conclusions can be reached until
  a historical record dealing with that event is found [@horn1967babylonian, 16]
