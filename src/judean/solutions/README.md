# Solutions to the Judean Chronology

A number of authors have proposed different solutions for interpreting and synchronising
the chronological data, and as a result come to different dates for the destruction of Jerusalem, including:

| Author              | Publication                                                                                     | Year on Babylonian Calendar | Year BC |

| Floyd N. Jones      | Chronology of the Old Testament [@jones2019chronology]                                          | 19                          | 586     |
| Abraham Malamat     | The twilight of Judah: in the Egyptian-Babylonian maelstrom [@malamat1975twilight]              | 19                          | 586     |

| William F. Albright | The Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar Chronicles [@albright1956nebuchadnezzar]                     | 18                          | 587     |
| John P. Hyatt       | New Light on Nebuchadrezzar and Judean History [@hyatt1956new]                                  | 18                          | 587     |
| Roger C. Young      | When Did Jerusalem Fall? [@young2004did]                                                        | 18                          | 587     |
| Watchtower Society  | Insight on the Scriptures [@watch2018insight1] [@watch2018insight2]                             | 18                          | 607*    |

<sup>* The Watchtower does believe that Jerusalem was captured in Nebuchadnezzar's 18th regnal year
[@watch2018insight2, {481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR}], but uses a very different system to date this on the Julian calendar - this
is discussed in [Chapter 4](../../watchtower/README.md).</sup>

We will see that all of the proposed solutions fail to definitively satisfy all the chronological data, and therefore 
we are unable to give a certain date for the destruction of Jerusalem:

> no definite and unassailable conclusions can be reached until
  a historical record dealing with that event is found [@horn1967babylonian, 16]
