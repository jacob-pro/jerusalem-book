              in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,
              832 people from Jerusalem;
              in his twenty-third year,
              745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard.
              There were 4,600 people in all."

## Jeremiah 52

Jeremiah 52 is very similar to 2 Kings 25; I have not repeated the identical key points.

The differences between the two chapters include:

- Jeremiah has an additional three introduction verses (52:1-3)
- Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem on the 10th instead of 7th day (52:12 vs 25:8)
- Jeremiah describes the loot in greater detail (52:20-23 vs 25:16-17)
- 7 rather than 5 royal advisers were taken. (52:25 vs 25:19)
- Jeremiah has three additional verses counting the captives (52:28-30)
- Jehoiakim is released on the 25th day rather than 27th day (52:31 vs 25:27)
