# Issues Synchronising Babylonian and Judean Chronology

At first, it would appear that there are significant contradictions, both internally within the Bible, and when
synchronising with the Babylonian texts, which make it very hard to put together a coherent timeline of events. The key
issues include:

## Battle of Carchemish

- The 4th year of Jehoiakim = 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 25:1)
- Pharaoh Necho was defeated at Carchemish in the 4th year of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 46:2)
- (Between month I-V) 21st year of Nabopolassar (= accession year of Nebuchadnezzar) Egypt was defeated at Carchemish
  ([Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle / BM 21946 Obv. 1-10](../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md))

Was the 4th year of Jehoiakim (and therefore the battle of Carchemish) in the accession or 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar?

## Siege of Jerusalem (Resulting in Jehoiachin’s Capture)

- Jehoiachin taken captive in the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:12)
- Nebuchadnezzar took 3023 Jews into exile in his 7th year (Jeremiah 52:28)
- Nebuchadnezzar seized the king of Judah on 2/XII of his 7th year
  ([Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle / BM 21946 Rev. 11-12](../standard/chronicles/bm21946.md))

Were Jehoiachin and the other captives taken in the 7th or 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar?

## Siege of Jerusalem (Resulting in Zedekiah’s Capture)

- On 7th (or 10th) day, month V in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:8)
  (Jeremiah 25:12) and took Jews into exile.
- In the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 people were taken into exile (Jeremiah 52:29).

If the Babylonians did not break into the city until the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, then why does Jeremiah only list
captives as being taken in the 18th year (and not the 19th)?
