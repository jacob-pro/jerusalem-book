# Reign of Cyrus

In order to determine when the 70 years of Jeremiah (25:11) ended and the Jews returned to Jerusalem
(2 Chronicles 36:23, Ezra 1:1) the Watchtower needs to date the reign of Cyrus, and his conquest of Babylon. 
They have therefore offered a couple of different sources:

## Olympiad Numbers

> Diodorus of Sicily (c. 80-20 B.C.E.) wrote that Cyrus became king of Persia
  in “the opening year of the Fifty-fifth Olympiad.” (Historical Library,
  Book IX, 21) That year was 560 B.C.E. The Greek historian
  Herodotus (c. 485-425 B.C.E.) stated that Cyrus was killed “after
  he had reigned twenty-nine years,” which would put his death
  during his 30th year, in 530 B.C.E. (Histories, Book I, Clio, 214)
  Cuneiform tablets show that Cyrus ruled Babylon for nine years
  before his death. Thus, nine years prior to his death in 530 B.C.E.
  takes us back to 539 B.C.E. as the year Cyrus conquered Babylon. [@watch2011when1, 28]

> The date of 539 B.C.E. for the fall of Babylon can be arrived at not only by Ptolemy’s canon but by other sources as 
  well. The historian Diodorus, as well as Africanus and Eusebius, shows that Cyrus’ first year as king of Persia 
  corresponded to Olympiad 55, year 1 (560/559 B.C.E.), while Cyrus’ last year is placed at Olympiad 62, year 2 
  (531/530 B.C.E.). Cuneiform tablets give Cyrus a rule of nine years over Babylon, which would therefore substantiate 
  the year 539 as the date of his conquest of Babylon.—Handbook of Biblical Chronology, by Jack Finegan, 1964, 
  pp. 112, 168-170; Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.–A.D. 75, p. 14 [@watch2018insight1, 454]

Diodorus:

> Cyrus became king of the Persians in the opening year of the Fifty-fifth Olympiad, as may be found in the Library of 
  Diodorus and in the histories of Thallus and Castor and Polybius and Phlegon and all others who have used the 
  reckoning by Olympiads. For all these writers agree as to the date. [@diodorus1989diodorus, {31, IX 21}]

Herodotus:

> The greater part of the army of the Persians was
  destroyed, and Cyrus himself fell, after reigning
  nine and twenty years. [@rawlinson1909history1, {204, Book I 214}]

Africanus:

> Cyrus igitur anno imperii sui primo, qui Olympiadis quinquagesimæ quintæ primus item annus erat, per Zorobabelem, 
  cujus etiam æqualis idem et socius erat Jesus Josedeci filius, expleta jam septuaginta annorum summa, populi Judaici 
  partem aliquam primum dimisit, ut apud Esdram Hebræum historicum legimus. [@routh1846reliquiae2, 271]

(Cyrus was in the first year of his reign which was the fifty-fifth Olympiad the first year = 560 BC. 
[@finegan1998handbook, {156, 288}])

### Problems

Using the Olympiad numbers Africanus also dates the 20th year of Artaxerxes to 445 BC:

> For from Nehemiah, who was despatched
  by Artaxerxes to build Jerusalem in
  the 115th year of the Persian empire, and the
  4th year of the 83d Olympiad, and the 20th year
  of the reign of Artaxerxes himself, up to
  this date, which was the second year of the 202d
  Olympiad, and the 16th year of the reign of
  Tiberius Caesar, there are reckoned 475 years,
  which make 490 according to the Hebrew numeration, 
  as they measure the years by the
  course of the moon ; so that, as is easy to show,
  their year consists of 354 days, while the solar
  year has 365¼days. [@roberts1886ante6, {135, Africanus III XVI}]

<sup>(1st olympiad = 776 BC, 83rd Olympiad = 448 BC, 4th year = 445 BC)</sup>

However this is in direct contradiction with the Insight book chronology chapter, and the Watchtower's interpretation
of Daniel's 70 weeks prophesy (Daniel 9:24):

> The next date of major importance is the 20th year of Artaxerxes (Longimanus), the year Nehemiah received permission 
  to go and rebuild Jerusalem. (Ne 2:1, 5-8) The reasons for favoring the date of 455 B.C.E. for this year as against 
  the popular date of 445 B.C.E. are considered in the article PERSIA, PERSIANS. The events of this year that involve 
  the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls mark the starting point of the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks” at 
  Daniel 9:24-27. The weeks there are clearly “weeks of years” (Da 9:24, RS, AT, Mo), totaling 490 years. As 
  demonstrated under the heading SEVENTY WEEKS, the prophecy pointed to Jesus’ appearance as the Messiah in the year 
  29 C.E.; his death at “the half of the week” or in the middle of the last week of years, that is, in 33 C.E.; and 
  the end of the period of God’s special favor to the Jews in 36 C.E. Thus, the 70 weeks of years closed with the 
  conversion of Cornelius, 490 years from the year 455 B.C.E.—Ac 10:30-33, 44-48; 11:1. [@watch2018insight1, 463]

Africanus also dates the birth of Jesus to 3/2 BC and his death and resurrection to 29/30 AD 
[@finegan1998handbook, 158]). However this is also in contradiction with the Insight book which says:

> Jesus’ birth would come about six months later in the fall of 2 B.C.E., his ministry would start about 30 years
  later in the fall of 29 C.E., and his death would come in the year 33 C.E. (on Nisan 14 in the spring, as stated).
  [@watch2018insight2, 58]

For the Watchtower's chronology to work it also means dismissing other reigns and dates given by the same
historians [for the 26th dynasty of Egypt](../../orthodox/egypt/historians.md), since otherwise 
Necho could not have been Pharaoh at the time of the battle of Megiddo or Carchemish.

In summary the Watchtower doesn't make clear why the Olympiad numbers given by the ancient historians for Cyrus' reign
should be trusted, whilst at the same time implicitly rejecting the other dates that the historians provide for Persian, 
Egyptian, and Christian history.

## BM 33066

> A Babylonian astronomical
  clay tablet (BM 33066) confirms the date of Cyrus’ death in
  530 B.C.E. Though this tablet contains some errors regarding the
  astronomical positions, it contains the descriptions of two lunar
  eclipses that the tablet says occurred in the seventh year of Cambyses
  II, the son and successor of Cyrus. These are identified
  with lunar eclipses visible at Babylon on July 16, 523 B.C.E., and
  on January 10, 522 B.C.E., thus pointing to the spring of
  523 B.C.E. as the beginning of Cambyses’ seventh year. That
  would make his first regnal year 529 B.C.E. So Cyrus’ last year
  would have been 530 B.C.E., making 539 B.C.E. his first year of
  ruling Babylon. [@watch2011when1, 28]

> A Babylonian clay tablet is helpful for connecting Babylonian chronology with Biblical chronology. This tablet 
  contains the following astronomical information for the seventh year of Cambyses II son of Cyrus II: “Year 7, 
  Tammuz, night of the 14th, 1 2⁄3 double hours \[three hours and twenty minutes\] after night came, a lunar eclipse; 
  visible in its full course; it reached over the northern half disc \[of the moon\]. Tebet, night of the 14th, two and 
  a half double hours \[five hours\] at night before morning \[in the latter part of the night\], the disc of the moon 
  was eclipsed; the whole course visible; over the southern and northern part the eclipse reached.” (Inschriften von 
  Cambyses, König von Babylon, by J. N. Strassmaier, Leipzig, 1890, No. 400, lines 45-48; Sternkunde und Sterndienst 
  in Babel, by F. X. Kugler, Münster, 1907, Vol. I, pp. 70, 71) These two lunar eclipses can evidently be identified 
  with the lunar eclipses that were visible at Babylon on July 16, 523 B.C.E., and on January 10, 522 B.C.E. 
  (Oppolzer’s Canon of Eclipses, translated by O. Gingerich, 1962, p. 335) Thus, this tablet points to the spring of 
  523 B.C.E. as the beginning of the seventh year of Cambyses II.
  <br><br>
  Since the seventh year of Cambyses II began in spring of 523 B.C.E., his first year of rule was 529 B.C.E. and 
  his accession year, and the last year of Cyrus II as king of Babylon, was 530 B.C.E. The latest tablet dated in 
  the reign of Cyrus II is from the 5th month, 23rd day of his 9th year. (Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.–A.D. 75, 
  by R. Parker and W. Dubberstein, 1971, p. 14) As the ninth year of Cyrus II as king of Babylon was 530 B.C.E., his 
  first year according to that reckoning was 538 B.C.E. and his accession year was 539 B.C.E. [@watch2018insight1, 453]

BM 33066 (Strm. Kambys. 400) (LBAT 1477) is one of the tablets mentioned in the 
[Astronomical Texts](../../orthodox/astro.md) section, and covered in my 
[astro-tablets](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm33066.md) project.
It does indeed date the 7th year of Cambyses to 523 BC.

The Watchtower offers the Babylonian [Business Tablets](../../orthodox/business/README.md) as the sole source for the 
length of Cyrus' reign as king of Babylon, the last tablets being dated to his 9th year. Counting backwards Babylon must
have fallen to Cyrus in 539 BC.

### Problems

As we will see later in this chapter (section [Criticism of Orthodox Babylonian Chronology](../criticisms/README.md))
the Watchtower using these sources as a base for their "Biblical chronology" contradicts their own arguments; in short:

- It is not clear how the Watchtower can justify using 
  [BM 33066](https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm33066.md)
  (which has a number of serious inaccuracies [@britton2008remarks, 7])
  to be a valid source of chronological information,
  whilst rejecting the dates of [seven other astronomical texts](../../orthodox/astro.md).
- Using the latest dated business tablet as the only evidence for the end of Cyrus' reign doesn't make much sense
  given that for the 70 year prophesy to be correct relies on the assumption that the business tablets do not
  constitute a "continuous chronological record".
