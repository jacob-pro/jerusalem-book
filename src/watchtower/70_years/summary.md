# Summary and Implications

## Accuracy

The series "The Bible—A Book of Accurate Prophecy" in the _Awake!_ magazine attempts to demonstrate the 
"divine inspiration" of Jeremiah's 70 year prophesy.

Regarding the 70 year period (Jeremiah 25:11) the _Awake!_ says:

> Fulfillment: After an extended siege, Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. He also conquered other 
  Judean cities, including Lachish and Azekah. (Jeremiah 34:6, 7) He deported most of the survivors to Babylon, where 
  they were held captive for 70 years.<br>
  What history reveals:<br>
  \- The Bible identifies Nebuchadnezzar as being the king of Babylon about the time of Jerusalem’s destruction. 
  Archaeological evidence supports the Bible’s testimony about his existence. A cameo made of onyx stone is on display 
  in Florence, Italy. It bears an inscription that says in part: “In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, 
  king of Babylon, in his life-time had this made.” Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.<br>
  \- The book The Bible and Archaeology says that excavations and surveys in Lachish confirm the following: “The final 
  destruction was violent, and so fierce was the fire which destroyed the city \[Lachish\] that the limestone of the 
  buildings turned to lime. [@watch2012accurate, 13]

However as we have seen there is no evidence for the dating the destruction of Jerusalem to 607 BC apart from first 
assuming the 70 year prophesy did come true, assuming that the Jews returned in the 2nd year of Cyrus, and 
then counting back 70 years from 537 BC.

Then the "What history reveals" contains the statement that Nebuchadnezzar "ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.", but no 
historical evidence for this has been provided (independent of Jeremiah's prophesy which this paragraph is trying
to prove the accuracy of).
