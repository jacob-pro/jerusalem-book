# Summary and Implications

## Accuracy

The series "The Bible—A Book of Accurate Prophecy" in the _Awake!_ magazine attempts to demonstrate the 
"divine inspiration" of Jeremiah's 70 year prophesy.

Regarding the 70 year period (Jeremiah 25:11) the _Awake!_ says:

> Fulfillment: After an extended siege, Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. He also conquered other 
  Judean cities, including Lachish and Azekah. (Jeremiah 34:6, 7) He deported most of the survivors to Babylon, where 
  they were held captive for 70 years.<br>
  What history reveals:<br>
  ● The Bible identifies Nebuchadnezzar as being the king of Babylon about the time of Jerusalem’s destruction. 
  Archaeological evidence supports the Bible’s testimony about his existence. A cameo made of onyx stone is on display 
  in Florence, Italy. It bears an inscription that says in part: “In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, 
  king of Babylon, in his life-time had this made.” Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.<br>
  ● The book The Bible and Archaeology says that excavations and surveys in Lachish confirm the following: “The final 
  destruction was violent, and so fierce was the fire which destroyed the city \[Lachish\] that the limestone of the 
  buildings turned to lime. [@watch2012accurate, 13]

However as we have seen there is no evidence for the dating the destruction of Jerusalem to 607 BC apart from first 
assuming the 70 year prophesy did come true, assuming that the Jews returned in the 2nd year of Cyrus, and 
then counting back 70 years from 537 BC.

Then the "What history reveals" contains the statement that Nebuchadnezzar "ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.", but no 
historical evidence for this has been provided (independent of Jeremiah's prophesy which this paragraph is trying
to prove the accuracy of).

Regarding the return of the exiles (Jeremiah 29:10) the _Awake!_ says:

> Fulfillment: After 70 years of exile, from 607 to 537 B.C.E., King Cyrus of Persia released the Jewish captives and 
  allowed them to return to their homeland to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.—Ezra 1:2-4.<br>
  What history reveals:<br>
  ● Did the Israelites remain captive in Babylon for 70 years as the Bible foretold? Note the comments of a leading 
  Israeli archaeologist, Ephraim Stern. “From 604 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.—there is a complete gap in evidence suggesting 
  occupation. In all that time, not a single town destroyed by the Babylonians was resettled.” The so-called gap in 
  which there was no occupation or resettling of conquered territory corresponds closely to Israel’s exile in Babylon 
  from 607 to 537 B.C.E.—2 Chronicles 36:20, 21.<br>
  ● Ancient nations throughout Mesopotamia wrote on tablets made of soft clay. One hardened clay tablet, known as the 
  Cyrus Cylinder, dates back to about 539 B.C.E., the same year that King Cyrus of Persia overthrew the Babylonian 
  Empire. One inscription reads: “I am Cyrus, . . . king of Babylon.” The same inscription goes on to report: “I 
  returned to \[certain previously named\] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have 
  been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein . . . I (also) gathered all their (former) 
  inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.” This secular source harmonizes with the Bible prophecy that 
  states that the Jewish exiles would be repatriated to their homeland—a prophecy recorded about 200 years in advance.

The quotation of Stern would appear to be grossly misleading, in full context he actually says:

> The savage Babylonian destruction of
  Jerusalem is well documented both in
  the Bible (in the books of Jeremiah and
  Lamentations) and in the archaeological
  record. When Nebuchadnezzar first
  placed the city under siege in 597
  B.C.E., the city quickly capitulated,
  thereby avoiding a general destruction.
  But in response to a revolt by Judah's
  King Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar dispatched
  an army that, after an 18-
  month siege, captured and destroyed the
  city in 586 B.C.E. The
  evidence of this destruction is widely confirmed
  in Jerusalem excavations.
  <br><br>
  On his first swing through Judah,
  Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed much of
  Philistia-Ekron, Tel Barash, Tell Jemmeh,
  Ruqeish and Tel Sera'. Particularly devastated
  was Ashkelon, which the Babylonians
  sacked in 604 B.C.E.
  <br><br>
  Similar evidence of Babylonian destruction
  can be found throughout the Beersheba
  Valley, in the Aravah (the valley south
  of the Dead Sea) and in the Jordan River
  valley. From south to north, we can trace
  the effects of Babylonian might-at Tell
  el-Kheleifeh on the coast of the Red Sea,
  at Ein Gedi on the shore of the Dead
  Sea, and further north at Dan, the source
  of the Jordan River. The same is true in
  excavations at major northern sites Hazor;
  Megiddo, overlooking the Jezreel
  Valley; and Dor, on the Mediterranean
  coast-and in central Judah, where, in addition
  to Jerusalem, we may look at Rarnat
  Rahel and Lachish, among other sites.
  <br><br>
  But the strange thing is that above the
  remains left by these destructions, we find
  no evidence of occupation until the
  Persian period, which began in about 538
  B.C.E. For roughly half a century-from
  604 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.-there is a
  complete gap in evidence suggesting
  occupation. In all that time, not a single
  town destroyed by the Babylonians
  was resettled. This is true even of the
  old Assyrian fortresses along the Way of
  the Sea (the Via Maris); they were reoccupied
  only in the Persian period, as shown
  by the recently excavated fort at Rishon
  le-Zion. [@stern2000babylonian, 46]

And further on in his article:

> The destruction of Judah is followed by
  the Persian period, when, following the
  eclipse of the Babylonians by the comparatively
  benign Persians, the Jewish exiles
  were permitted to return to Palestine.
  <br><br>
  I do not mean to imply that the country
  was uninhabited during the period
  between the Babylonian destruction and
  the Persian period. There were undoubtedly
  some settlements, but the population
  was very small. Many towns and villages
  were either completely or partly
  destroyed. The rest were barely functioning.
  International trade virtually ceased. Only
  two regions appear to have been spared
  this fate-the northern part of Judah (the
  region of Benjamin) and probably the land
  of Ammon, although the latter region
  awaits further investigation. [@stern2000babylonian, 51]

The _Awake!_ claims that their 607-537 BC period for a deserted Jerusalem is supported by Stern's 604-538 BC period
during which cities destroyed by Babylon were not resettled. However as can be seen Stern does not believe
Jerusalem was destroyed or unoccupied until 586 BC. The year 604 is referring to the city of Ashkelon being plundered
in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar (see [BM 21946](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.md) Obv. 18).
