> 7 “But you did not listen to me,” declares the Lord, “and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, 
  and you have brought harm to yourselves.”
  <br><br>
  8 Therefore the Lord Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to my words, 9 **I will summon all the peoples 
  of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the Lord, “and I will bring them against this 
  land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them** and make them an 
  object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin. 10 I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the 
  voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. 11 This whole country will become 
  a desolate wasteland, and **these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years**.
  <br><br>
  12 “But **when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation**, the land of the 
  Babylonians, for their guilt,” declares the Lord, “and will make it desolate forever. 13 I will bring on that land 
  all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all 
  the nations.

> 17 He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, 
  and did not spare young men or young women, the elderly or the infirm. God gave them all into the hands of 
  Nebuchadnezzar. 18 He carried to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the 
  treasures of the Lord’s temple and the treasures of the king and his officials. 19 They set fire to God’s temple and 
  broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there.
  <br><br>  
  20 He carried into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and his 
  successors until the kingdom of Persia came to power. 21 **The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its 
  desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken by 
  Jeremiah**.
  <br><br>  
  22 **In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia**, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the 
  Lord moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in

  23 “This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
  <br><br>
  “‘The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and **he has appointed me to build a temple 
  for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Any of his people among you may go up, and may the Lord their God be with them**.’”
