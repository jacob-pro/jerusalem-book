# Return of the Exiles

## Background

The Watchtower accepts the year 539 BC as the date of the fall of Babylon to Cyrus 
[@watch2018insight1, {453, Chronology}] [@watch2011when1, 28]. 
The [Nabonidus Chronicle](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.md) describes the fall in detail;
the Babylonian army was defeated in the 7th month (III, Lines 12-18), and Cyrus entered the city of Babylon on the 3rd 
day of the 8th month (III, Line 18), these dates are accepted by the Watchtower 
[@watch2018insight1, {568, Cyrus}] [@watch2018insight2, {459, Nabonidus}].
Cyrus' accession was therefore around the end of October 539 BC, and his first year as king of Babylon would have began
in the spring of 538 BC.

## The Watchtower's Date

The Watchtower lists the year 537 BC as the time that the Jews returned to Jerusalem:

> During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing
  the Jews from exile was given. And, as considered
  in the article on CYRUS, it is very probable that the
  decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward
  the spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit
  the Jews time to make necessary preparations, effect
  the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and
  still arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri,
  or about October 1) of 537 B.C.E.—Ezr 1:1-11;
  2:64-70; 3:1. [@watch2018insight1, {458, Chronology}]

> In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree
  freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was
  made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E.
  This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare
  to move out of Babylon and make the long
  trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could
  take about four months according to Ezr 7:9) and
  yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh
  month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E. (Ezr
  3:1, 6) This marked the end of the prophesied 70
  years of Judah’s desolation that began in the
  same month, Tishri, of 607 B.C.E.—2Ki 25:22-26;
  2Ch 36:20, 21. [@watch2018insight1, {568, Cyrus}]

> The 70th year of Jerusalem’s desolation,
  the last enforced sabbath on the land, would end
  in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must
  have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in
  537 for two reasons. The desolation had to last
  until the 70th year ended, and the released Israelites
  would not be expected to travel in the winter
  rainy season, as would have been the case if
  the decree had been made a few months earlier.
  Likely it was issued in the early spring of
  537 B.C.E. in order to give the Jews a chance to
  travel during the dry season, arrive in Jerusalem,
  and set up the altar on the first day of the seventh
  month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September
  29 according to the Gregorian calendar.
  —Ezr 3:2-6. [@watch2018insight1, {800, Ezrah}]

## Issues

The Watchtower does not appear to provide any valid justification as to how they can be sure it was the
year 537 BC that the Jews returned to Jerusalem and not some other point within Cyrus reign (539-530 BC).

For example some historians suggest that Cyrus issued his decree near the start of his first year, and therefore the 
exiles had returned by the 7th month in 538 BC:

> It is a reasonable hypothesis, therefore, that work was begun on the
  Temple site under the direction of Sheshbazzar as soon as the returning
  exiles reached Jerusalem, probably in 538 since, though Cyrus' first year
  ran from spring 538 to spring 537, he had taken Babylon in October 539,
  and it is unlikely that he would have allowed any great time to elapse
  before he issued the decree. According to the Book of Ezra, Zerubbabel,
  Joshua the high priest, and others assembled in Jerusalem in the seventh
  month. There they built an altar and re-established the giving of burnt-offerings
  on it, celebrating in particular the observances of the festival of
  Succoth (Booths or Tabernacles) (Ezra 3:1—6; I Esdras 5:46—52). In the
  Jewish calendar, Succoth was kept in the seventh month, Tishri, to mark
  the time of harvest (Lev. 23:33-6; Deut. 16:13—15). This strongly
  suggests that the 'seventh month' in which Zerubbabel built the altar
  was Tishri in 538, rather than simply the seventh month after the return
