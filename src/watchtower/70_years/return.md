# Return of the Exiles

## Background

The Watchtower accepts the year 539 BC as the date of the fall of Babylon to Cyrus 
[@watch2018insight1, {453, Chronology}] [@watch2011when1, 28]. 
The [Nabonidus Chronicle](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.md) describes the fall in detail;
the Babylonian army was defeated in the 7th month (III, Lines 12-18), and Cyrus entered the city of Babylon on the 3rd 
day of the 8th month (III, Line 18), these dates are accepted by the Watchtower 
[@watch2018insight1, {568, Cyrus}] [@watch2018insight2, {459, Nabonidus}].
Cyrus' accession was therefore around the end of October 539 BC, and his first year as king of Babylon would have began
in the spring of 538 BC.

## The Watchtower's Date

The Watchtower lists the year 537 BC as the time that the Jews returned to Jerusalem:

> During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing
  the Jews from exile was given. And, as considered
  in the article on CYRUS, it is very probable that the
  decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward
  the spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit
  the Jews time to make necessary preparations, effect
  the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and
  still arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri,
  or about October 1) of 537 B.C.E.—Ezr 1:1-11;
  2:64-70; 3:1. [@watch2018insight1, {458, Chronology}]

> In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree
  freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was
  made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E.
  This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare
  to move out of Babylon and make the long
  trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could
  take about four months according to Ezr 7:9) and
  yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh
  month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E. (Ezr
  3:1, 6) This marked the end of the prophesied 70
  years of Judah’s desolation that began in the
  same month, Tishri, of 607 B.C.E.—2Ki 25:22-26;
  2Ch 36:20, 21. [@watch2018insight1, {568, Cyrus}]

## Alternatives

Some historians suggest that Cyrus issued his decree near the start of his first year, and therefore the 
exiles had returned by the 7th month in 538 BC:

> It is a reasonable hypothesis, therefore, that work was begun on the
  Temple site under the direction of Sheshbazzar as soon as the returning
  exiles reached Jerusalem, probably in 538 since, though Cyrus' first year
  ran from spring 538 to spring 537, he had taken Babylon in October 539,
  and it is unlikely that he would have allowed any great time to elapse
  before he issued the decree. According to the Book of Ezra, Zerubbabel,
  Joshua the high priest, and others assembled in Jerusalem in the seventh
  month. There they built an altar and re-established the giving of burnt-offerings
  on it, celebrating in particular the observances of the festival of
  Succoth (Booths or Tabernacles) (Ezra 3:1—6; I Esdras 5:46—52). In the
  Jewish calendar, Succoth was kept in the seventh month, Tishri, to mark
  the time of harvest (Lev. 23:33-6; Deut. 16:13—15). This strongly
  suggests that the 'seventh month' in which Zerubbabel built the altar
  was Tishri in 538, rather than simply the seventh month after the return
  [@boardman2008cambridge, 432]

On the other hand Steinmann argues that it would have taken 5 years from Cyrus decree before the exiles
returned to Jerusalem, which would be 533 BC:

> Thus it is possible with external information to determine when Sheshbazzar
  and Zerubbabel led the Judean exiles back to Jerusalem and the Persian
  province of Yehud. While five years may seem like a long time between
  Cyrus’s decree and the return to Jerusalem, the details in Ezra 1–2 would
  seem to indicate that an immediate return would have been unlikely. First
  of all, there was a time of preparation to make the return. Ezra 1:6 indicates
  a concerted effort by those who remained in Babylon to help equip and finance
  the return. This was probably not a quick process given all that was donated.
  Second, it is unlikely that the returnees simply dropped everything in
  order to return. There was property to sell, accounts to settle, travel arrangements 
  to be made. Third, Ezra 2:64–65 and Neh 7:66 indicate that about
  50,000 people made the trip to Jerusalem. Organizing such a large group
  would not happen quickly. Finally, it would have been unlikely that Cyrus’s
  treasurer Mithredath would have turned over the temple vessels to any
  Judean who presented himself as leader of the returning Judeans, no matter
  how prominent he may have been (Ezra 1:8). Instead, it is more reasonable
  to assume that the exiles first organized themselves and their leaders requested
  that one of them be named governor of Yehud and entrusted with
  the vessels.
  <br><br>
  For these reasons, a five-year period of planning and organization is not
  at all unreasonable. Furthermore, this five-year delay explains why, after
  making only a beginning by laying the foundation, the Judeans were forced
  to stop. Had they returned immediately with the decree of Cyrus still new,
  it is unlikely that their building program could have been successfully opposed
  in the court of Cyrus as indicated by Ezra 4:5. It simply would be unlikely
  for the king or his officials to reverse policy so abruptly and quickly. If, however,
  the Judeans returned in 533 BC and began to build in 532 BC during
  their second year in Jerusalem, the decree would have been some six years
  old—long enough in the past that it was capable of being opposed and
  allowing for the opposition to persuade Persian authorities to halt the work.
  Thus from the text of Ezra and the evidence of the sabbatical year cycles
  of the post-exilic era we can be reasonably certain that Sheshbazzar and
  Zerubbabel and the people with them returned in 533 BC. [@steinmann2008chronological]

Furthermore as we have already seen the Watchtower is assuming that the Bible writers were counting the reign of
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, inclusive of his accession year [@watch2018insight2, {481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR}]
(see section [Watchtower Judean Chronology](../../judean/solutions/watchtower.md)). We must therefore ask
if the Bible writers were doing the same when they refer "the first year of Cyrus"; could the edict have been
issued as early as the October of 539 BC up to Nisan in 538 BC?
 
## Issues

As we have seen the date that the exiles returned to Jerusalem is used by the Watchtower to calculate
the destruction of Jerusalem (by counting back 70 years). How can the Watchtower be so sure that this date was 537 BC
and not one of the other possibilities?

> The 70th year of Jerusalem’s desolation,
  the last enforced sabbath on the land, would end
  in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must
  have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in
  537 for two reasons. The desolation had to last
  until the 70th year ended, and the released Israelites
  would not be expected to travel in the winter
  rainy season, as would have been the case if
  the decree had been made a few months earlier.
  Likely it was issued in the early spring of
  537 B.C.E. in order to give the Jews a chance to
  travel during the dry season, arrive in Jerusalem,
  and set up the altar on the first day of the seventh
  month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September
  29 according to the Gregorian calendar.
  —Ezr 3:2-6. [@watch2018insight1, {800, Ezrah}]

> Jehovah God had decreed that their land should rest without inhabitants for seventy years. Its seventieth year of 
  sabbath-keeping began in the early autumn of 538 B.C., about the time of the Jewish Day of Atonement. Cyrus’ decree 
  of liberation was published in the first year of his reign. Babylon fell before him in 539 B.C., and Bible 
  chronologers figure that his first regnal year began in the spring of the year following, on Nisan 1, 538 B.C., which 
  would be six months before the seventieth year of sabbath-keeping of the land of Judah began. If Cyrus had issued his 
  decree early in 538 B.C. as his first regnal year, the exiled Jews could have made the journey back to their land 
  before its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping began, which would have been contrary to Jehovah’s prophecy. Or they 
  might have had to journey through the rainy winter months of the year, which would be from October through March. 
  This would not be too good.
  <br><br>
  By the calculation above, Cyrus’ first regnal year would end on March 5 of 537 B.C., or toward the end of the rainy 
  season. Doubtless he considerately issued his decree near the end of the rainy season, shortly before March 5 of 
  537 B.C., and in that way the exiled Israelites could make arrangements to travel in the convenient dry season from 
  April through September. They evidently made the four-month-long journey from Babylon during the dry months, for by 
  October they were back and settled in their beloved homeland, before the first day of their seventh lunar 
  month.—Ezra 3:1. [@watch1964comely, 80]

The Watchtower offers two reasons, however both are invalid. The first is the speculation that Cyrus must have issued 
his decree at the end of the rainy season - even if this were true, we have seen above that
this does not mean the Jews must have returned in 537 BC, for example Cyrus could have issued his decree in the 
first few months of his first year, such that the Jews would have had plenty
of time to make travel to Jerusalem before the 7th month of 538 BC (as described by The Cambridge Ancient History). 

The second reason given is that "The desolation had to last until the 70th year ended" however this is an example
of **circular reasoning**, since the Watchtower only knows when the 70 years began by counting backwards from when
they ended. As stated in the Watchtower 2011:

> When Did “the Seventy Years” Start?
  <br>...<br> 
  So this event evidently marked the starting point of the 70 years. 
  And what year was that? To answer, we need to see when that period ended. [@watch2011when1, {27-28}]
