# Watch Tower Chronology

The aim of this section is to answer the question of why Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem actually
took place in 607 BC.

Three subsections will explain:

- The Biblical and archaeological sources, combined with the theological interpretations used by the Watch Tower to
  arrive at the 607 BC date.
- The historical development of the Watch Tower's chronology surrounding the 607 BC date.
- The Watch Tower's criticism of the sources behind the [standard chronology](../standard/standard.md) which contradicts
  their unusual date.
