# History of the Watchtower Chronology

As explained in the section [Significance to Jehovah’s Witnesses](../../introduction/significance.md) the date of
Jerusalem's destruction is significant within Jehovah's Witness eschatology as the basis of their 'Gentile Times' belief
derived from Daniel Chapter 4's 'seven times'.

According to the _Proclaimers_ book the first known interpretation of the 'seven times' in Daniel 4 as a prophetic
period was published in 1823 by John Aquila Brown in _The Even-Tide_ [@watchtower1993proclaimers, 134]:

> As early as 1823, John A. Brown, whose work was published in London, England, calculated the “seven times” of Daniel
> chapter 4 to be 2,520 years in length. But he did not clearly discern the date with which the prophetic time period
> began or when it would end. He did, however, connect these “seven times” with the Gentile Times of Luke 21:24.

This statement is actually only partially true since Brown did in fact give a beginning and end date [@brown1823even,
135]:

> Commencing, therefore, the calculation of the “seven times,” from the first year of Nebuchadnezzar A.C. 604, whose
> kingdom is the golden head of the image, and is represented by the towering and palmy “tree,” previously to its
> desolation, the termination of these 2520 years will fall out in the year 1917.

Brown also did not connect the 'seven times' of Daniel 4 to Luke 21:24 as claimed in _Proclaimers_, instead he
identified the 'Gentile Times' with the ‘time, times, and a half’ of Daniel [@brown1823even, {XI}]:

> The “times of the Gentiles,” during which Jerusalem is to be trodden down of the Gentiles, as declared by Christ, and
> by the Apostle Paul, as well as by the Prophet John, in his vision of the two witnesses, are therefore unquestionably
> the “time, times, and a half,” predicted by the Prophet Daniel, when your desolation is to cease; and he defines these
> times to be twelve hundred and sixty days or years.

_The Even Tide_ was the first of many publications throughout the 19th century to apply a 2520-year prophetic period to
a variety of different starting points and chronologies. A number of these interpretations terminated in 1914, the first
of which was published in 1844 by E B Elliott [@elliott1847horae, 265], long before Jehovah's Witnesses began to use
this date:

> And 1st, on the seven times of Nebuchadnezzar's insanity and state of bestialism. These, calculated after the year-day
> system, on the hypothesis of the Babylonish king's insanity figuring that of the great empires which he then headed,
> in their state of heathen aberration from God, (an hypothesis on the truth of which I do not myself entertain much
> doubt,) terminate, —if dated from the time, B.C. 727, when the Assyrians under Shalmanezer first acted the wild
> beast's part against Israel,—about the year 1793; that is, at the epoch of the French Revolution, and the coincident
> going forth of the gospel-message to evangelize the heathen: doubtless a very remarkable synchronism: especially
> considering that the bisecting point of these seven times is then A.D. 533; the very commencing epoch, with
> Justinian's Decree, of the three and a half times of the Papal Antichrist. Of course if calculated from
> Nebuchadnezzar's own accession and invasion of Judah, B.C. 606, the end is much later, being A.D. 1914; just one half
> century, or jubilean period, from our probable date of the opening of the Millennium.

This section will now track how the Watchtower's interpretation of the 'Gentile Times' prophecy developed and changed
over time, starting with Charles Taze Russell's publications in the late 19th century.
