# The Watchtower 1949

The chronology was again revised in the November 1st Watchtower 1949 [@watch1949close, 326].

## On the date of Babylon's Fall

Like the _Kingdom_ book (1944) before it the Watchtower is now using the correct year for Babylon's fall, and this time
they have given the sources they got this date from [@watch1949close, 328].

> The Bible time-table connects up with the timetable
  of mundane history at the first year of Cyrus
  the Great, king of Persia. Cyrus, together with his
  uncle Darius the Mede, overthrew the empire of
  Babylon. On this the 1944 edition of _The Westminster
  Dictionary of the Bible_ says in its table under "Chronology"
  (page 108): "B.C. 539 Cyrus takes Babylon."
  _The Encyclopedia Americana_ of 1929 also says under
  "Cyrus the Great" (page 373): "In 546 he conquered
  Crœsus, the rich and powerful king of Lydia, and in
  539 took Babylon, which did not offer much resistance,
  being torn by internal dissensions." The _Encyclopædia 
  Britannica_ (eleventh edition, of 1910) says
  under "Cyrus the Great" (page 707): "Why the war
  with Babylon, which had become inevitable, was
  delayed until 539, we do not know. Here too Cyrus
  in a single campaign destroyed a mighty state. The
  army of Nabonidus was defeated; Babylon itself
  attempted no resistance, but surrendered on the 16th
  Tishri (10th of October) 539, to the Persian general
  Gobryas." 

However there is a contradiction in using these sources,
since every single one of them also gives the date of Jerusalem's destruction as 586 B.C.:

- _The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible_: in the very same page the Watchtower has quoted from it also lists
  the Temple of Jerusalem being destroyed in the 5th month of 586 BC [@davis1944westminster, 108].
- _The Encyclopedia Americana_ (1922 edition*): "As Zedekiah who succeeded Jehoiakin in the latter’s exile entered into 
  a treaty with Egypt Nebuchadnezzar’s army besieged and captured Jerusalem a second time, carrying off Zedekiah into 
  captivity (586 B.C.)" [@encyclopedia1922americana20, 34].
- _Encyclopædia Britannica_ (11th edition): "Zedeklah's revolt in 588 B.C led to another siege of Jerusalem, which was 
  taken and destroyed in 586 B.C." [@encyclopædia1911britannica19, 332].

<sup>*I was unable to find the 1929 edition, but I believe there are only minor changes in the reprints following
 the original 1918 edition.</sup>

## On Cyrus' first year

The Watchtower is still insistent that "_Darius the Mede_" became king of Babylon after its fall [@watch1949close, 328]:

> This Gobryas is frequently identified as Darius
  the Mede. Daniel 9:1 and 11:1 speak of "the first
  year of Darius" as "king over the realm of the Chaldeans".
  Babylon was overthrown in October of
  539 B.C., but the ordinary Babylonian reckoning of
  a king's reign was from the 1st of the month Nisan
  in the spring of the year. Hence the months from
  October of 539 to Nisan 1, 538 B.C., were referred
  to as the "beginning of kingship". The first full year
  of Darius would therefore be from Nisan 1, 538 B.C.,
  to the end of the month Adar in 537 B.C., or, about,
  March 24, 538, to March 11, 537 B.C., Julian Calendar
  (or, March 18, 538, to March 5, 537 B.C., Gregorian
  Calendar).

But this time they offer two different theories on when "the first year of Cyrus" began; either that his first year
began in Nisan 538 BC as a co-regency with "_Darius the Mede_" [@watch1949close, 328]:

> The first year of Cyrus is now usually
  given as 538 B.C. So if Cyrus reigned along with
  Darius, the first full year of Cyrus allowed more
  than two months in 537 B.C., for Cyrus to issue his
  decree for rebuilding the temple at Jerusalem.

Or alternatively that it began in 537 BC after "_Darius the Mede_" had ruled for one year [@watch1949close, 328]:

> But if Cyrus succeeded to Darius during or right after
  Darius' first year, then the first full year of Cyrus
  would run from Nisan 1, 537 B.C., to the end of
  Adar, 536 B.C., or, about, March 12, 537, to March 29,
  536 B.C., Julian Calendar (or, March 6, 537, to
  March 23, 536 B.C., Gregorian Calendar). This would
  allow sufficient months in the year 537 B.C. for Cyrus'
  decree to get over all his kingdom, for contributions
  for the temple building to be made, for preparations
  and the journey to Jerusalem to be made by the
  Israelites, and for them to settle in their cities before
  the first day of the seventh month (Tishri) in 537 B.C.
  -Ezra 1: 1; 2: 68-70; 3: 1, 6. See the footnote. ‡ 

In the first theory they state that Cyrus issued his decree near the **end of his first year** (approx Jan-Mar 537 BC),
whereas in the second theory they state Cyrus must have issued his decree near the **start his first year**
(approx Apr-Jun 537 BC).
The footnote does in fact acknowledge the reason behind this strange contradiction and insistence on the 537 BC date
regardless of when Cyrus' first year actually began [@watch1949close, 328]:

> ‡ We hold to the year 537 B.C. as the year for the resettlement
  of the remnant of faithful Jews in Jerusalem and Judea. It is on
  the basis of this resettlement that the 70 years of desolation of
  their land is calculated as having begun in 607 B.C. Whether the
  time of their arrival and resettlement there be reckoned as in the
  first or the second full year of Cyrus' reign makes no difference.
  In either case, as above shown, Cyrus' decree and the Jews'
  resettlement could both be in 537 B.C.

This is very similar to what we found in section [Return of the Exiles](../70_years/return.md#issues); it is 
a form of circular reasoning:

Assumption A: "Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 BC because this is 70 years before the return of the exiles in 537 BC". 

Assumption B: "The exiles returned in 537 BC (and not 538 BC or 536+ BC) because it is 70 years after Jerusalem was 
destroyed in 607 BC".
