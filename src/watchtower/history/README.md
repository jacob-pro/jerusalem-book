# History of the Watchtower Chronology

As explained in the section [Significance to Jehovah’s Witnesses](../../introduction/significance.md) the date
of Jerusalem's destruction is significant within Jehovah's Witness eschatology as the basis of their '_Gentile Times_'
belief derived from Daniel Chapter 4's '_seven times_'.

According to the Proclaimers book the first known interpretation of the ‘_seven times_’ in Daniel 4 as a prophetic 
period was published in 1823 by John Aquila Brown in the _The Even-Tide_:

> As early as 1823, John A. Brown, whose work was published in London, England, calculated the “seven times” of Daniel 
  chapter 4 to be 2,520 years in length. But he did not clearly discern the date with which the prophetic time period 
  began or when it would end. He did, however, connect these “seven times” with the Gentile Times of Luke 21:24.
  [@watchtower1993proclaimers, 134]

This statement is actually only partially true since he did in fact give a beginning and end date:

> Commencing, therefore, the calculation of the “seven times,” from the first year of Nebuchadnezzar
  A.C. 604, whose kingdom is the golden head of the image, and is represented by
  the towering and palmy “tree,” previously to its desolation, the termination of these 2520 years
  will fall out in the year 1917. [@brown1823even, 135]

Brown also did not connect the '_seven times_' of Daniel 4 to Luke 21:24 as claimed by the Watchtower.
Instead he identified the Gentile times with the ‘_time, times, and a half_’ of Daniel:

> The “times of the Gentiles,” during which Jerusalem is to be trodden down of the Gentiles, as declared
  by Christ, and by the Apostle Paul, as well as by the Prophet John, in his vision of the two witnesses,
  are therefore unquestionably the “time, times, and a half,” predicted by the Prophet Daniel, when your desolation
  is to cease; and he defines these times to be twelve hundred and sixty days or years. [@brown1823even, {XI}]

_The Even Tide_ was the first of many publications throughout the 19th century to apply a 2520 year
prophetic period to a variety of different starting points and chronologies. A number of these interpretations
terminated in 1914, the first of which was published in 1844 by E B Elliott.

> And 1st, on the seven times of Nebuchadnezzar's 
  insanity and state of bestialism. These,
  calculated after the year-day system, on the hypothesis
  of the Babylonish king's insanity figuring that of the
  great empires which he then headed, in their state of
  heathen aberration from God, (an hypothesis on the truth of
  which I do not myself entertain much doubt,) terminate,
  —if dated from the time, B.C. 727, when the Assyrians
  under Shalmanezer first acted the wild beast's part
  against Israel,—about the year 1793; that is, at the
  epoch of the French Revolution, and the coincident
  going forth of the gospel-message to evangelize the
  heathen: doubtless a very remarkable synchronism:
  especially considering that the bisecting point of these
  seven times is then A.D. 533; the very commencing
  epoch, with Justinian's Decree, of the three and a half
  times of the Papal Antichrist. Of course if calculated
  from Nebuchadnezzar's own accession and invasion of
  Judah, B.C. 606, the end is much later, being A.D.
  1914; just one half century, or jubilean period, from
  our probable date of the opening of the Millennium. [@elliott1847horae, 265]

This section will now track how the Watchtower's interpretation of the '_Gentile Times_' prophesy developed
and changed over time, starting with Charles Taze Russell's publications in 1877.
