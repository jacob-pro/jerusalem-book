# The Watchtower 1968

The sources for dating the fall of Babylon to 539 B.C. are covered extensively in the article _The Book of Truthful 
Historical Dates_ [@watch1968book].

## The Nabonidus Chronicle

Thw Watchtower again claims that the Nabonidus chronicle may be used to determine the date 539 B.C [@watch1968book, 490].

> The fixing of 539 B.C.E. as the year when this historical event occurred is based on a stone document known as the 
  Nabonidus (Nabunaid) Chronicle. This important find was discovered in ruins near the city of Baghdad in 1879, and it 
  is now preserved in the British Museum. A translation of this finding was published by Sidney Smith in Babylonian 
  Historical Texts Relating to the Capture and Downfall of Babylon, London, 1924, and reads in part:
  <br><br>
  “In the month of Tashritu \[Tishri, Hebrew 7th month\], when Cyrus attacked the army of Akkad in Opis on the Tigris, 
  the inhabitants of Akkad revolted, but he (Nabonidus) massacred the confused inhabitants. The 14th day, Sippar was 
  seized without battle. Nabonidus fled. The 16th day \[October 11-12, 539 B.C.E., Julian, or October 5-6, Gregorian\] 
  Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Gutium and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon without battle. Afterwards Nabonidus 
  was arrested in Babylon when he returned (there). . . . In the month of Arahshamnu \[Heshvan, Hebrew 8th month\], the 
  3rd day \[October 28-29, Julian\], Cyrus entered Babylon, green twigs were spread in front of him—the state of 
  ‘Peace’ (Sulmu) was imposed upon the city.”—Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament 
  (Princeton; 1955), James B. Pritchard, p. 306.
  <br><br>
  Please note, the Nabonidus Chronicle gives precise details as to the time when these events took place. This, in 
  turn, enables modern scholars, with their knowledge of astronomy, to translate these dates into terms of the 
  Julian or Gregorian calendars.

However as we have already seen in the previous two sections this does not make sense; the Nabonidus chronicle
doesn't contain a year for the fall of Babylon, nor any datable astronomical observations.

Further it should be noted that the Julian/Gregorian dates (in square brackets) were not part of Pritchard's
translation [@pritchard1969ancient, 306]; presumably they were added by the author of this Watchtower article.

The next paragraph also directly quotes Parker and Dubberstein's page on Nabonidus reign 
[@dubberstein1956babylonian, 13], but as already stated in the previous section, their chronology is based
upon the Ptolemaic canon which contradicts the Watchtower's "Biblical" chronology 
[@dubberstein1956babylonian, {10, 18}].

## Encyclopedia Quotations etc.

The Watchtower again offers a new set of quotations from 21 sources that support the 539 B.C. date [@watch1968book, 491].
They also note that this date has been "generally accepted for the past sixty years" which raises the question of why
their earlier publications such as the [1943 The Truth Shall Make You Free](./1943.md) were still using incorrect dates 
for the fall of Babylon?

> Recognized authorities of today accept 539 B.C.E. without any question as the year Babylon was overthrown by Cyrus 
  the Great. In addition to the above quotations the following gives a small sampling from books of history 
  representing a cross section of both general reference works and elementary textbooks. These brief quotations also 
  show that this is not a date recently suggested, but one thoroughly investigated and generally accepted for the past 
  sixty years.

However if we look up each of these 21 sources we find:

1. The _Encyclopædia Britannica_ (14th Edition, 1929): "Zedkiah's revolt in 588 B.C. led to another siege of Jerusalem,
   which was taken and destroyed in 586 B.C." [@encyclopædia1929britannica16, 185]. (Also see 1972 edition: "Jerusalem was
   sacked in 587 B.C." [@encyclopædia1972britannica16, 157]).
   
2. _The Encyclopedia Americana_ (1968): "In 586 B.C. he destroyed Jerusalem" 
   [@encyclopedia1968americana20, {48b}].
   
3. _Nabonidus and Belshazzar_ (1929): "Jerusalem fell in 586 B.C." [@dougherty1929nabonidus, {36, 58}].

4. _The World Book Encyclopedia_ (1988): "He captured Jerusalem in 587 or 586 B.C." 
   [@world1988book14, 116].
   
5. _Readings in Ancient History_ (1913): The Watchtower quotation appears to be in **error** since I cannot find it
   in the cited publication [@webster1913readings, 64]. It is possible that this was confused with another publication
   by H Webster: _Early European History_ (1917) where the exact quote can instead be found on page 38. The pages before
   also say "He captured Jerusalem in 586 B.C." [@webster1917early, 36].
   
6. _The Story of the Ancient Nations_ (1912): "finally, in the year 586 B.C., Jerusalem itself was taken and 
   destroyed." [@westermann1912story, 69].
   
7. _History of the Hebrews_ (1914): "In July, 586 B.C., a year and a half after the first appearance of the Chaldeans 
   (II Ki. 25: 1-3), a breach was made in the wall of Jerusalem" [@sanders1914history, 198].
   
8. _The Jews: Their History, Culture, and Religion_ (1955): "Finally, in August, 587, Jerusalem was stormed" 
   [@finkelstein1955jews, 47].
   
9. _Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary_ (1963): "there is no record of the final and brutal devastation of Jerusalem
    in 586 B.C." [@tenney1963zondervan, 576].
    
10. _World History at a Glance_ (1942): "in 612 B.C. the Chaldeans, took Nineveh and destroyed the city" (which was 
    the 14th year of Nabopolassar - see [Fall of Nineveh Chronicle](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.md)).

11. _The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible_ (1962): "There is then no reasonable escape from a 586 date for
    Jerusalem's fall" [@buttrick1962interpreter, 598].

12. _The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopaedia_ (1922): "Nebuchadnezzar, who finally captured Jerusalem in the 
    eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign (B.C. 588)" [@fallows1922popular, 1222].
