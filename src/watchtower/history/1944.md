# The Kingdom Is At Hand (1944)

A year later the Watchtower published _The Kingdom Is At Hand_ making further changes to the chronology.

The date for Jerusalem's destruction remains unchanged from 606 BC:

> The following chronology shows the date of Jerusalem’s destruction as in the year 607 before
  Christ. This recognizes the fact that the ancient reckoning of the vulgar year began in the fall.
  In other words, the vulgar year 606 B.C. really began in the fall of 607 B.C. As stated on page
  239 (¶1) of “The Truth Shall Make You Free”: “Inasmuch as the count of the Gentile 'seven
  times' began its first year at the fall of 607 B.C., it is simple to calculate when they end. From
  the fall of 607 B.C. to the fall of B.C. 1 is exactly 606 years. ... Hence from the fall of B.C. 1 to
  the fall of A.D. 1914 is 1,914 years.” [@watch1944kingdom, 171]

However the dates for the fall of Babylon and Cyrus’ first year have been shifted back by 1 year:

> According to the most accurate histories, Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian, his nephew,
  jointly took the capital of the Babylonian empire in 539 B.C. After Darius’ brief rule there,
  Cyrus came to power, in 537 B.C. That year marked the end of the seventy years’ desolation
  of Jerusalem, and that very year Jehovah God stirred up the heart of Cyrus to let his captives
  go free. [@watch1944kingdom, 195]

## Issues

The _Kingdom_ book is now using the correct year: 539 BC for Babylon's fall, but they are still insistent on two
years rule for _Darius the Mede_ before Cyrus' first year began. Again no evidence is provided to justify 
how they arrived at these dates.
