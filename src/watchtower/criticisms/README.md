# Criticism of Orthodox Babylonian Chronology

As we have seen in the [Babylonian chronology section](../../orthodox/README.md), the sources we have for the
chronology of the Neo-Babylonian period are in direct contradiction with the chronology Jehovah's Witnesses use
as the foundation for their understanding of "biblical prophesy".
As a result it is no surprise that various Watchtower publications have been written criticising the validity
of these sources.
