# Criticism of the Business Tablet Record

## Watchtower 2011

The Watchtower 2011 [@watch2011when2, 23] starts by quoting R.H. Sack regarding the overlap between the last known
tablets for Nebuchadnezzar and the earliest known tablets for Amel-Marduk:

> **What have experts said?** R. H. Sack examined numerous business tablets from the Neo-Babylonian period. In 1972,
> Sack wrote that new unpublished British Museum texts placed at his disposal “completely upset” previous conclusions
> regarding the transition of rule from Nebuchadnezzar II to his son Amel-Marduk (also known as
> Evil-merodach).<sup>6</sup> How so? Sack knew that tablets showed Nebuchadnezzar II to be still ruling in the sixth
> month of his last (43rd) year. But these newly deciphered tablets from the accession year of the following king,
> Amel-Marduk, were dated to the fourth and fifth months of what had been assumed to be the same year.<sup>7</sup>
> Clearly, there was a discrepancy.<br><br> 6. Amel-Marduk 562-560 B.C.​—A Study Based on Cuneiform, Old Testament,

First it should be noted that according to the British Museum website the date of BM 80920 is actually month 7 of
Amel-Marduk's accession year [@bm80920].

The Watchtower goes onto claim that there are even more substantial overlaps:

> **What do the documents show?** There are further discrepancies in the transition of one king to another. For example,
> the documents show that Nebuchadnezzar II was still ruling in his tenth month​—six months after his successor is
> assumed to have begun reigning.<sup>8</sup> A similar discrepancy exists with the transition between Amel-Marduk and
> his successor, Neriglissar.<sup>9</sup><br><br> 8. The tablet in the British Museum (BM 55806) is dated to the tenth
> month, 43rd year.<br> 9. Tablets BM 75106 and BM 61325 are dated in the seventh and tenth months of what is considered
> the last (second) year of the ruling king Evil-merodach. However, the tablet BM 75489 is dated in the second month of
> the accession year of Neriglissar, his successor.​—Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, Volume

> Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, Volume VII, (Tablets From Sippar 2) by Erle Leichty and A.
> K. Grayson, published 1987, page 36.<br> Neriglissar​—King of Babylon, by Ronald H. Sack, published 1994, page 232.
> The month on the tablet is Ajaru (second month).<br>

In the case of BM 55806, the museum website states that 'the year number is far from clear' [@bm55806].
