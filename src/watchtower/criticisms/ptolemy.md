# Criticism of Ptolemy's Canon

Ever since its founding in the late 19th century the Watchtower has repeatedly flip-flopped in its use of 
Ptolemy's Canon.

## Three Worlds (1877) and Millennial Dawn II (1889)

As seen in the section on [Russell and Barbour](../history/russell.md), Ptolemy's canon was supposedly used
by Barbour and the Russell as the source of their chronology [@barbour1877three. 194]  [@russell1889millenial2, 79].

> The fact that the first year of Cyrus was B.C. 536, is based on Ptolemy’s canon, supported by the eclipses by which 
  the dates of the Grecian and Persian era have been regulated.

> With these facts before us, we readily find the date for the beginning of the Gentile Times of dominion; for the first 
  year of the reign of Cyrus is a very clearly fixed date — both secular and religious histories with marked unanimity 
  agreeing with Ptolemy’s Canon, which places it B.C. 536.

## Watchtower 1952 - 1971

As we saw in the [History of the Watchtower Chronology](../history/README.md) from 1952 up to 1971 the Watchtower
were now claiming that Babylon fell in 539 B.C. [@watch1968book, 490]:

> The fixing of 539 B.C.E. as the year when this historical event occurred is based on a stone document known as the 
  Nabonidus (Nabunaid) Chronicle. 

Of course the [Nabonidus Chronicle](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.md) doesn't contain anything datable
on the Julian/Gregorian calendar. The footnotes in each of these issues of the Watchtower actually cite
Parker and Dubberstein's tables, which were in turn principally based upon Ptolemy's canon 
[@dubberstein1942babylonian, 8], and would have been used to map the dates in the Nabonidus chronicle:

> The general basis for the chronology of the period here treated is furnished by the Ptolemaic Canon, with help from 
  classical sources.

When the Watchtower 1971 ceased claiming the Nabonidus chronicle could be used to date the fall of Babylon
they instead directly cited the canon:

> Also other sources, including Ptolemy’s canon, point to the year 539 B.C.E. as the date for Babylon’s fall.
