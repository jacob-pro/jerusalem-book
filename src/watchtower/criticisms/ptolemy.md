# Criticism of Ptolemy's Canon

Ever since its founding in the late 19th century the Watchtower has repeatedly flip-flopped in its use of 
Ptolemy's Canon.

## Three Worlds (1877) and Millennial Dawn II (1889)

As seen in the section on [Russell and Barbour](../history/russell.md), Ptolemy's canon was supposedly used
by Barbour and the Russell as the source of their chronology [@barbour1877three. 194]  [@russell1889millennial2, 79].

> The fact that the first year of Cyrus was B.C. 536, is based on Ptolemy’s canon, supported by the eclipses by which 
  the dates of the Grecian and Persian era have been regulated.

> With these facts before us, we readily find the date for the beginning of the Gentile Times of dominion; for the first 
  year of the reign of Cyrus is a very clearly fixed date — both secular and religious histories with marked unanimity 
  agreeing with Ptolemy’s Canon, which places it B.C. 536.

## Watchtower (1952 - 1971)

As we saw in the [History of the Watchtower Chronology](../history/README.md) from 1952 up to 1971 the Watchtower
were now claiming that Babylon fell in 539 BC [@watch1968book, 490]:

> The fixing of 539 B.C.E. as the year when this historical event occurred is based on a stone document known as the 
  Nabonidus (Nabunaid) Chronicle. 

The [Nabonidus Chronicle](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.md) doesn't actually contain anything datable
to the Julian calendar, but footnotes in each of these issues of the Watchtower actually cite
Parker and Dubberstein's tables, which were in turn principally based upon Ptolemy's canon 
[@dubberstein1942babylonian, 8], and would have been used to map the dates in the Nabonidus chronicle:

> The general basis for the chronology of the period here treated is furnished by the Ptolemaic Canon, with help from 
  classical sources.

When the Watchtower 1971 ceased claiming the Nabonidus chronicle could be used to date the fall of Babylon
they instead directly cited the canon:

> Also other sources, including Ptolemy’s canon, point to the year 539 B.C.E. as the date for Babylon’s fall. 
  [@watch1971testimony, 316]

## Watchtower (1969)

The first major criticism of Ptolemy's canon is in the 1969 article 'Babylonian Chronology — How Reliable?'
[@watch1969babylonian, 90], it claims that the chronology of Ptolemy's canon leads to a 'gap' in Assyrian chronology:

> On the other hand, those who hold to a strict Ptolemaic reckoning are obliged to explain a sizable gap of their own. 
  This gap develops when they attempt to harmonize Babylonian and Assyrian history so as to arrive at 625 B.C.E. for the 
  start of the Neo-Babylonian period.
  <br/>
  The Babylonian Chronicle states that Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, fell to the Babylonian forces in Nabopolassar’s 
  fourteenth year. Following Ptolemy, the secular historians date that event in 612 B.C.E. At the same time, on the 
  basis of astronomical calculations, they also hold to the year 763 B.C.E. as an absolute date representing the 
  ninth year of Assyrian king Assur-dan III. So, they should be able to count forward from that year and show that 
  Assyrian rule at Nineveh did extend as far as 612 B.C.E. But can they? Well, with the help of eponym and king lists 
  and other source material, they manage to set up a chronology that reaches as far as 668 B.C.E., the year they assign 
  for the start of Ashurbanipal’s reign. But from that point forward there is considerable confusion.

The Watchtower alleges that there is a 'gap' in the reign of Sinsharishkun:

> As might be expected, the above sources also give varied dates for the reign of Ashurbanipal’s probable successor, 
  Ashur-etillu-ilani. And so, too, for the reign of Sin-shar-ishkun, apparently the king at the time of Nineveh’s fall. 
  Some historians extend this last king’s reign for as long as eighteen years, though dated tablets have been found only 
  up to his seventh year. 
  <br/>
  Thus historians are willing to exhibit much flexibility in order to hold to both the Ptolemaic chronology and their 
  pivotal date of 763 B.C.E., even to the point of conjecturing longer reigns for these final rulers of the Assyrian 
  empire than the evidence at hand will support. They have an awkward gap on their hands—one that is not easy to fill.

However, what is known is that Sinsharishkun's accession year occurred around 627 BC (the year prior 
to Nabopolassar's accession) [@reade1970accession, 2] [@naaman1991chronology, 246]. The evidence includes:

- The [Uruk King List](../../orthodox/im65066.md) names Sinsharishkun as king in the year prior to Nabopolassar.
- The chronicle [BM 25127](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm25127.md) (lines 1-14) names Sinsharishkun as being in command of 
  the Assyrian army in the months prior to Nabopolassar's accession [@gadd1958harran, 71].

The Watchtower is correct that Sinsharishkun died during Nineveh's fall (see the chronicle 
[BM 21901](../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.md)), if fails to mention that this event is dated to Nabopolassar's 14th 
year in 612 BC, hence proving Sinsharishkun did indeed reign for more than 7 years (approximately 16).
