<p>The Watch Tower accepts the year 539 BC as the date of the fall of
Babylon to Cyrus II <a href="#ref-watch2018insight1">[1, p. 453]</a> <a href="#ref-watch2011when1">[2, p.
28]</a>. The <a href="../../standard/chronicles/bm35382.html">Nabonidus
Chronicle</a> describes the fall in
detail; the Babylonian army was defeated in the 7th month (III, Lines
12-18), and Cyrus entered the city of Babylon on the 3rd day of the 8th
month (III, Line 18), these dates are accepted by the Watch Tower <a href="#ref-watch2018insight1">[1,
p. 568]</a> <a href="#ref-watch2018insight2">[3, p.
459]</a>. Cyrus' accession was therefore around
the end of October 539 BC, and his first year as king of Babylon would
have begun in the spring of 538 BC.</p>
<h2 id="the-watch-towers-date"><a class="header" href="#the-watch-towers-date">The Watch Tower's Date</a></h2>
<p>The Watch Tower lists the year 537 BC as the time that the Jews returned
to Jerusalem <a href="#ref-watch2018insight1">[1, p. 458]</a> <a href="#ref-watch2018insight1">[1, p.
568]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing the Jews from exile was
given. And, as considered in the article on CYRUS, it is very probable
that the decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward the
spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit the Jews time to make necessary
preparations, effect the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and still
arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri, or about October 1) of 537
B.C.E.—Ezr 1:1-11; 2:64-70; 3:1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return
to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537
B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move
out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip
that could take about four months according to Ezr 7:9) and yet be
settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh month” (Tishri) of
the year 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 3:1, 6) This marked the end of the prophesied
70 years of Judah’s desolation that began in the same month, Tishri,
of 607 B.C.E.—2Ki 25:22-26; 2Ch 36:20, 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>Some historians suggest that Cyrus issued his decree near the start of
his first year, and therefore the exiles had returned by the 7th month
in 538 BC <a href="#ref-boardman2008cambridge">[4, p. 432]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a reasonable hypothesis, therefore, that work was begun on the
Temple site under the direction of Sheshbazzar as soon as the
returning exiles reached Jerusalem, probably in 538 since, though
Cyrus' first year ran from spring 538 to spring 537, he had taken
Babylon in October 539, and it is unlikely that he would have allowed
any great time to elapse before he issued the decree. According to the
Book of Ezra, Zerubbabel, Joshua the high priest, and others assembled
in Jerusalem in the seventh month. There they built an altar and
re-established the giving of burnt-offerings on it, celebrating in
particular the observances of the festival of Succoth (Booths or
Tabernacles) (Ezra 3:1—6; I Esdras 5:46—52). In the Jewish calendar,
Succoth was kept in the seventh month, Tishri, to mark the time of
harvest (Lev. 23:33-6; Deut. 16:13—15). This strongly suggests that
the 'seventh month' in which Zerubbabel built the altar was Tishri in
538, rather than simply the seventh month after the return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand Steinmann argues that it would have taken 5 years from
Cyrus' decree before the exiles returned to Jerusalem, which would be
533 BC <a href="#ref-steinmann2008chronological">[5]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it is possible with external information to determine when
Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel led the Judean exiles back to Jerusalem and
the Persian province of Yehud. While five years may seem like a long
time between Cyrus’s decree and the return to Jerusalem, the details
in Ezra 1–2 would seem to indicate that an immediate return would have
been unlikely. First of all, there was a time of preparation to make
the return. Ezra 1:6 indicates a concerted effort by those who
remained in Babylon to help equip and finance the return. This was
probably not a quick process given all that was donated. Second, it is
unlikely that the returnees simply dropped everything in order to
return. There was property to sell, accounts to settle, travel
arrangements to be made. Third, Ezra 2:64–65 and Neh 7:66 indicate
that about 50,000 people made the trip to Jerusalem. Organizing such a
large group would not happen quickly. Finally, it would have been
unlikely that Cyrus’s treasurer Mithredath would have turned over the
temple vessels to any Judean who presented himself as leader of the
returning Judeans, no matter how prominent he may have been (Ezra
1:8). Instead, it is more reasonable to assume that the exiles first
organized themselves and their leaders requested that one of them be
named governor of Yehud and entrusted with the vessels.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a five-year period of planning and organization is
not at all unreasonable. Furthermore, this five-year delay explains
why, after making only a beginning by laying the foundation, the
Judeans were forced to stop. Had they returned immediately with the
decree of Cyrus still new, it is unlikely that their building program
could have been successfully opposed in the court of Cyrus as
indicated by Ezra 4:5. It simply would be unlikely for the king or his
officials to reverse policy so abruptly and quickly. If, however, the
Judeans returned in 533 BC and began to build in 532 BC during their
second year in Jerusalem, the decree would have been some six years
old—long enough in the past that it was capable of being opposed and
allowing for the opposition to persuade Persian authorities to halt
the work. Thus from the text of Ezra and the evidence of the
sabbatical year cycles of the post-exilic era we can be reasonably
certain that Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel and the people with them
returned in 533 BC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, as we have already seen the Watch Tower is assuming that
the Bible writers were counting the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, inclusive of his accession year <a href="#ref-watch2018insight2">[3, p.
481]</a> (see section <a href="../../judean/solutions/watchtower.html">Watch Tower Judean
Chronology</a>). We must therefore
ask if the Bible writers were doing the same when they refer 'the first
year of Cyrus'; could the edict have been issued as early as the period
from October 539 BC up to Nisan in 538 BC?</p>
<h2 id="issues"><a class="header" href="#issues">Issues</a></h2>
<p>As we have seen the date that the exiles returned to Jerusalem is used
by the Watch Tower to calculate the destruction of Jerusalem (by
counting back 70 years). How can the Watch Tower be so sure that this
date was 537 BC and not one of the other possibilities? The Watch Tower
offers two reasons, however both are invalid <a href="#ref-watch2018insight1">[1, p.
800]</a> <a href="#ref-watch1964comely">[6, p. 80]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 70th year of Jerusalem’s desolation, the last enforced sabbath on
the land, would end in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must
have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in 537 for two reasons.
The desolation had to last until the 70th year ended, and the released
Israelites would not be expected to travel in the winter rainy season,
as would have been the case if the decree had been made a few months
earlier. Likely it was issued in the early spring of 537 B.C.E. in
order to give the Jews a chance to travel during the dry season,
arrive in Jerusalem, and set up the altar on the first day of the
seventh month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September 29 according
to the Gregorian calendar. —Ezr 3:2-6.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jehovah God had decreed that their land should rest without
inhabitants for seventy years. Its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping
began in the early autumn of 538 B.C., about the time of the Jewish
Day of Atonement. Cyrus’ decree of liberation was published in the
first year of his reign. Babylon fell before him in 539 B.C., and
Bible chronologers figure that his first regnal year began in the
spring of the year following, on Nisan 1, 538 B.C., which would be six
months before the seventieth year of sabbath-keeping of the land of
Judah began. If Cyrus had issued his decree early in 538 B.C. as his
first regnal year, the exiled Jews could have made the journey back to
their land before its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping began, which
would have been contrary to Jehovah’s prophecy. Or they might have had
to journey through the rainy winter months of the year, which would be
from October through March. This would not be too good.</p>
<p>By the calculation above, Cyrus’ first regnal year would end on March
5 of 537 B.C., or toward the end of the rainy season. Doubtless he
considerately issued his decree near the end of the rainy season,
shortly before March 5 of 537 B.C., and in that way the exiled
Israelites could make arrangements to travel in the convenient dry
season from April through September. They evidently made the
four-month-long journey from Babylon during the dry months, for by
October they were back and settled in their beloved homeland, before
the first day of their seventh lunar month.—Ezra 3:1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first is the speculation that Cyrus must have issued his decree at
the end of the rainy season - even if this were true, we have seen above
that this does not mean the Jews must have returned in 537 BC, for
example Cyrus could have issued his decree in the first few months of
his first year, such that the Jews would have had plenty of time to make
travel to Jerusalem before the 7th month of 538 BC (as described by The
Cambridge Ancient History).</p>
<p>The second reason given is that 'The desolation had to last until the
70th year ended' however this is based upon circular reasoning, since
the Watch Tower only knows when the 70 years began by counting backwards
from when they ended. As stated in the Watch Tower 2011 <a href="#ref-watch2011when1">[2, pp.
27–28]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Did “the Seventy Years” Start? <br>...<br> So this event
evidently marked the starting point of the 70 years. And what year was
that? To answer, we need to see when that period ended.</p>
