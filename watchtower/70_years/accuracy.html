<p>Requiring a period of 70 years between the destruction of Jerusalem in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th/19th year and the return of Jewish captives
(somewhere around) Cyrus’ first year is clearly incompatible with all
the chronological data we have for <a href="../../standard/README.html">the Neo-Babylonian
period</a>. There is no historical evidence to
suggest that this prophesy of 70 years (as interpreted) came true.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-interpretations"><a class="header" href="#alternative-interpretations">Alternative Interpretations</a></h2>
<p>There are some alternative interpretations of Jeremiah’s prophesy that
could in theory satisfy the historical evidence however the Watchtower
has chosen to reject these [1, p. 138] [2, p. 27]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, based primarily on such secular records, some persons figure
that Jerusalem was destroyed in 587/6 B.C.E. and that the Jews came
under Babylonian domination in Nebuchadnezzar’s accession year, which
they calculate as being 605 B.C.E. They thus hold 605 B.C.E. to be the
date when Jeremiah 25:11 began to be fulfilled: “All the land shall be
a desolation; and they shall serve among the Gentiles seventy years.”
(Bagster’s Greek Septuagint) If that were so and the Gentile Times
were counted from then, it would put the end of the prophetic “seven
times” in the World War year of 1916. Yet, as stated, we believe that
there is much stronger reason for accepting the information in God’s
inspired Word, which points to the Gentile Times’ beginning in October
607 B.C.E. and ending in October of 1914 C.E.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of saying 70 years “at Babylon,” many translations read “for
Babylon.” (NIV) Some historians therefore claim that this 70-year
period applies to the Babylonian Empire. According to secular
chronology, the Babylonians dominated the land of ancient Judah and
Jerusalem for some 70 years, from about 609 B.C.E. until 539 B.C.E.
when the capital city of Babylon was captured. <br><br> The Bible,
however, shows that the 70 years were to be a period of severe
punishment from God—aimed specifically at the people of Judah and
Jerusalem, who were in a covenant to obey him. (Exodus 19:3-6) When
they refused to turn from their bad ways, God said: “I will summon …
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon … against this land and its inhabitants
and against all the surrounding nations.” (Jeremiah 25:4, 5, 8, 9,
NIV) While nearby nations would also suffer Babylon’s wrath, the
destruction of Jerusalem and the 70-year exile to follow were called
by Jeremiah “the punishment of my people,” for Jerusalem had “sinned
greatly.”—Lamentations 1:8; 3:42; 4:6, NIV.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="discussion-in-the-awake-2012"><a class="header" href="#discussion-in-the-awake-2012">Discussion in the <em>Awake!</em> 2012</a></h2>
<p>The series ‘The Bible — A Book of Accurate Prophecy’ in the <em>Awake!</em>
magazine attempts to demonstrate the ‘divine inspiration’ of Jeremiah’s
70 year prophesy.</p>
<p>Regarding the 70-year period (Jeremiah 25:11) the <em>Awake!</em> says [3, p.
13]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fulfillment: After an extended siege, Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jerusalem
in 607 B.C.E. He also conquered other Judean cities, including Lachish
and Azekah. (Jeremiah 34:6, 7) He deported most of the survivors to
Babylon, where they were held captive for 70 years.<br> What history
reveals:<br> ● The Bible identifies Nebuchadnezzar as being the king
of Babylon about the time of Jerusalem’s destruction. Archaeological
evidence supports the Bible’s testimony about his existence. A cameo
made of onyx stone is on display in Florence, Italy. It bears an
inscription that says in part: “In honour of Merodach, his lord,
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his life-time had this made.”
Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.<br> ● The book The Bible
and Archaeology says that excavations and surveys in Lachish confirm
the following: “The final destruction was violent, and so fierce was
the fire which destroyed the city [Lachish] that the limestone of
the buildings turned to lime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as we have seen there is no evidence for the dating the
destruction of Jerusalem to 607 BC apart from first assuming the 70 year
prophesy did come true, assuming that the Jews returned in the 2nd year
of Cyrus, and then counting back 70 years from 537 BC.</p>
<p>Then the ‘What history reveals’ section contains the statement that
Nebuchadnezzar ‘ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.’, but no historical
evidence for this has been provided (independent of Jeremiah’s prophesy
which this paragraph is trying to prove the accuracy of).</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the exiles (Jeremiah 29:10) the <em>Awake!</em> says
[3, p. 14]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fulfillment: After 70 years of exile, from 607 to 537 B.C.E., King
Cyrus of Persia released the Jewish captives and allowed them to
return to their homeland to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.—Ezra
1:2-4.<br> What history reveals:<br> ● Did the Israelites remain
captive in Babylon for 70 years as the Bible foretold? Note the
comments of a leading Israeli archaeologist, Ephraim Stern. “From 604
B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.—there is a complete gap in evidence suggesting
occupation. In all that time, not a single town destroyed by the
Babylonians was resettled.” The so-called gap in which there was no
occupation or resettling of conquered territory corresponds closely to
Israel’s exile in Babylon from 607 to 537 B.C.E.—2 Chronicles 36:20,
21.<br> ● Ancient nations throughout Mesopotamia wrote on tablets made
of soft clay. One hardened clay tablet, known as the Cyrus Cylinder,
dates back to about 539 B.C.E., the same year that King Cyrus of
Persia overthrew the Babylonian Empire. One inscription reads: “I am
Cyrus, . . . king of Babylon.” The same inscription goes on to report:
“I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other
side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a
long time, the images which (used) to live therein . . . I (also)
gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their
habitations.” This secular source harmonizes with the Bible prophecy
that states that the Jewish exiles would be repatriated to their
homeland—a prophecy recorded about 200 years in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quotation of Stern would appear to be grossly misleading, in full
context he actually says [4, p. 46]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The savage Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem is well documented both
in the Bible (in the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations) and in the
archaeological record. When Nebuchadnezzar first placed the city under
siege in 597 B.C.E., the city quickly capitulated, thereby avoiding a
general destruction. But in response to a revolt by Judah’s King
Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar dispatched an army that, after an 18- month
siege, captured and destroyed the city in 586 B.C.E. The evidence of
this destruction is widely confirmed in Jerusalem excavations.
<br><br> On his first swing through Judah, Nebuchadnezzar had
destroyed much of Philistia-Ekron, Tel Barash, Tell Jemmeh, Ruqeish
and Tel Sera’. Particularly devastated was Ashkelon, which the
Babylonians sacked in 604 B.C.E. <br><br> Similar evidence of
Babylonian destruction can be found throughout the Beersheba Valley,
in the Aravah (the valley south of the Dead Sea) and in the Jordan
River valley. From south to north, we can trace the effects of
Babylonian might-at Tell el-Kheleifeh on the coast of the Red Sea, at
Ein Gedi on the shore of the Dead Sea, and further north at Dan, the
source of the Jordan River. The same is true in excavations at major
northern sites Hazor; Megiddo, overlooking the Jezreel Valley; and
Dor, on the Mediterranean coast-and in central Judah, where, in
addition to Jerusalem, we may look at Rarnat Rahel and Lachish, among
other sites. <br><br> But the strange thing is that above the remains
left by these destructions, we find no evidence of occupation until
the Persian period, which began in about 538 B.C.E. For roughly half a
century-from 604 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.-there is a complete gap in
evidence suggesting occupation. In all that time, not a single town
destroyed by the Babylonians was resettled. This is true even of the
old Assyrian fortresses along the Way of the Sea (the Via Maris); they
were reoccupied only in the Persian period, as shown by the recently
excavated fort at Rishon le-Zion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further on in his article [4, p. 51]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The destruction of Judah is followed by the Persian period, when,
following the eclipse of the Babylonians by the comparatively benign
Persians, the Jewish exiles were permitted to return to Palestine.
<br><br> I do not mean to imply that the country was uninhabited
during the period between the Babylonian destruction and the Persian
period. There were undoubtedly some settlements, but the population
was very small. Many towns and villages were either completely or
partly destroyed. The rest were barely functioning. International
trade virtually ceased. Only two regions appear to have been spared
this fate-the northern part of Judah (the region of Benjamin) and
probably the land of Ammon, although the latter region awaits further
investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Awake!</em> claims that their 607-537 BC period for a deserted
Jerusalem is supported by Stern’s 604-538 BC period during which cities
destroyed by Babylon were not resettled. However as can be seen Stern
does not believe Jerusalem was destroyed or unoccupied until 586 BC. The
year 604 BC is referring to the Philistine city of Ashkelon being
plundered in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar (see <a href="../../standard/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> Obv. 18).</p>

<p>Jeremiah’s prophesy is discussed in Chapter 9 ‘Prophecies That Came
True’ [5, p. 120]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>7. How does archaeology testify to the fulfillment of the
prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah concerning Jerusalem?</sup> <br><br>
7 The Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land notes that when the
Babylonian onslaught was over, “the destruction of the city
[Jerusalem] was a total one.” Archaeologist W. F. Albright states:
“Excavation and surface exploration in Judah have proved that the
towns of Judah were not only completely destroyed by the Chaldeans in
their two invasions, but were not reoccupied for generations—often
never again in history.” Thus, archaeology confirms the shocking
fulfillment of this prophecy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst the chapter states that Jeremiah’s prophesy is confirmed by
archaeology, the provided evidence only demonstrates that Jerusalem was
destroyed, not that there was a 70 year period as claimed by the
Watchtower.</p>
