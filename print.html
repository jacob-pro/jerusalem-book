<p>The aim of this book is to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do historians claim the destruction of Jerusalem took place in
587/586 BC?</li>
<li>Why is there an uncertainty between 587 and 586 BC?</li>
<li>Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem
actually took place in 607 BC?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-the-author"><a class="header" href="#about-the-author">About the Author</a></h2>
<p>My name is Jacob Halsey, I am a software engineer / computer scientist.
My interest in this topic stems from being encouraged by friends and
family to research the Biblical prophecies of Daniel, and from having
read the “Daniel Book” [1] many years ago. I am not (and have never
been) a baptised member of Jehovah’s Witnesses myself.</p>

<p>The date of the destruction of Jerusalem is used as the foundation of a
very important belief to Jehovah’s Witnesses - the ‘<em>end of the Gentile
Times</em>’.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>Gentile times</em>’ is an interpretation of a prophesy found in Luke
21:24 combined with Daniel chapter 4. These times are believed to be
2520 years long, starting from the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BC
and ending in 1914 AD [1, p. 215].</p>
<p>According to the Watchtower 1986 [2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approved association with Jehovah’s Witnesses requires accepting the
entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, including those
Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. What do
such beliefs include? … That 1914 marked the end of the Gentile Times
and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as well as
the time for Christ’s foretold presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition the ‘<em>end of the Gentile Times</em>’ in 1914 is also used as a
foundation for a number of other interpretations of prophesy in the
‘<em>Time of the End</em>’ [3, p. 286]:</p>
<p>Daniel 12:7: ‘<em>a time, times and half a time</em>’ is interpreted as a
period of 1260 days running from December 1914 (release of 1915 year
text) to 21 June 1918 (the sentencing of J F Rutherford and other
directors of the Watch Tower Society) [4, p. 9].</p>
<p>Daniel 12:11: ‘<em>1290 days</em>’ is counted from the January 1919 (the
proposal of the League of Nations) until September 1922 (Bible student
convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A).</p>
<p>Daniel 12:12: ‘<em>the 1,335 days</em>’ is counted from September 1922 (see
above) until May 1926 (adoption of ‘<em>A Testimony to the Rulers of the
World</em>’, at the London convention).</p>

<p>The Babylonian calendar was made up of 12 lunar months. The year starts
at Nisanu in the Spring; within about 30 days of the vernal equinox [1,
p. 131]. However 12 lunar months are about 11 days short of a year, so
in order to prevent the months from drifting through the seasons, an
intercalary 13th month, either a second Ululu (VI₂) or a second Addaru
(XII₂), was occasionally inserted by decree of the King. Prior to
approx. 475 BC this was done at irregular intervals, a list of known
intercalary months is contained in Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D.
75 [2, p. 4].</p>
<p>The Babylonian day began at sunset. Each month starts “when the thin
crescent of the new moon was first visible in the sky at sunset” [2, p.
1]. The moon becomes visible between about 15 to 48 hours after
conjunction (at Mediterranean latitudes), although first sighting may
also be delayed by weather conditions, but not by more than one day [1,
p. 131].</p>
<h2 id="julian-and-gregorian-calendars"><a class="header" href="#julian-and-gregorian-calendars">Julian and Gregorian Calendars</a></h2>
<p>The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE [3].
However the primary calendar used today is the Gregorian calendar, named
after Pope Gregory XII who introduced it in October 1582. It is a minor
refinement to the Julian calendar with the aim of bringing the length of
an average year closer to an actual solar year, it does so by modifying
the rules used for choosing leap years.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar uses the following rule: “Every year that is
exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are
exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if
they are exactly divisible by 400.” the mean length is therefore
365.2425 days. Whereas the Julian calendar has a leap year every 4 years
and therefore has a 365.25 day mean length. The actual solar year is
approx. 365.2422 days.</p>
<p>In addition to changing the leap years, the Gregorian calendar was
offset by a 10 days to restore the date of Easter to the time which it
would have been celebrated by early church. In the 20th and 21st century
the Julian calendar would be about 13 days ahead of the Gregorian
calendar. Note that whilst the Gregorian calendar was quickly adopted in
Roman Catholic Europe, it took some time before the rest of the world
followed. It was adopted in Great Britain in 1752 and was not adopted in
most of Eastern Europe until the early 20th century.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar"><a class="header" href="#mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar">Mapping Babylonian dates to the Julian calendar</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of astronomy and historical dating it is standard
practice to use the Julian calendar when dealing with dates prior to 15
October 1582, and the Gregorian calendar for later dates. All calendar
dates that are used in this book when discussing the Neo-Babylonian era
will therefore be using the Julian calendar.</p>
<p>Also note that the year 0 BC / AD did not exist - rather the years
progress from 1 BC directly to 1 AD. Therefore when using negative years
there will be a 1 year difference; for example the year -100 is the same
year as 101 BC.</p>

<p>This chapter will look at some of the sources from which historians can
determine the chronology of the Neo-Babylonian period.</p>
<p>By doing so I will indirectly answer the first question (why historians
claim the destruction took place in 586/587 BC) by showing the dates for
the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II.</p>

<p>Concerning the early chronicles Grayson says [1, p. 14]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion it may be stated that Chronicles 1-7 represent only a
small part of a series of late Babylonian chronicles which, like all
chronicles of category A, were probably resumes or extracts made from
running accounts which were sometimes kept on writing-boards and these
running accounts were probably identical with astronomical diaries.
The narrative exhibits a narrow outlook restricted to matter of
concern to Babylonia, but within these confines the authors are
objective. Their main concern is to record what actually happened.
Thus one may use these documents as source material for the history of
the period with considerable confidence in their reliability.</p>

8  sacked them extensively, (and) abducted their gods. In the month Elul the king of Akkad and his army
9  returned and on his way he took (the people of) Hindanu and its gods to Babylon.
10 In the month Tishri the army of Egypt and the army of Assyria went after the king of Akkad as far as Gablini but

19 The king of Akkad stationed his army in the fortress of Takritain. The king of Assyria and his army
20 encamped against the army of the king of Akkad which was stationed in Takritain and
21 did battle against them for ten days. But he (the king of Assyria) did not capture the city. (Instead) the army of the king of Akkad, which had been stationed in the fortress,
22 inflicted a major defeat upon Assyria. The king of Assyria and his army [turned] and went home.
23 In the month Marchesvan the Medes went down to Arraphu and [...]

Albright says [5, p. 31]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the adverb means “victoriously,” and suggests that the Babylonians met
with stiff resistance from both the local population and its Egyptian
suzerains and allies.</p>

<p>The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for
administrative, legal, and economic purposes. By looking at the dates
that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were
from, can show us useful chronological information.</p>
<p>For example the dates have been used in the following publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [1, p. 10]</li>
<li>A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [2]

<p>The tablets therefore show that Kandalanu died somewhere between month
III and VIII of his 21st year, and that during the 22nd year there was
no other king in Babylon.</p>

<p>According to Wiseman: [12, p. 93]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chronicle (B.M. 25127, 11. I4-I5) expressly states that
Nabopolassar sat on the throne of Babylon on the 26th of Marcheswan
[VIII] … Unless a scribal error is assumed it would seem, therefore,
that Nabopolassar was acknowledged king at least at Sippar which had
become independent of Assyria before the final battle at Babylon.</p>

<li>20/V/Acc - Sippar, BM 75322 [20]</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these texts would overlap with the dates for Nebuchadnezzar II
by one month. R H Sack “proposes that Nebuchadrezzar bought his son into
a co-regency before his death”, which D J Wiseman agrees “is certainly
possible” [21, p. 451].</p>
<p>However D B Weisberg disagrees [22, p. 68]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a possible co-regency of Nebuchadnezzar and Amēl-Marduk does not seem
conclusive. … The dates we have for the end of one rule and the
beginning of another must be used with an understanding of the human
factors that led to their recording. An Uruk scribe still dating texts
to the reign of a deceased king (Nebuchadnezzar) might not have known
what was happening at the court. A Sippar scribe dating texts to
Amēl-Marduk might have picked up the news more quickly.</p>

<pre><code>   Col. I.
1.  I (am) the lady Adda-guppi' mother
2.  of Nabium-na'id, king of Babylon,
3.  votaress of the gods Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
4.  and Sadarnunna, my deities ;
5.  who, from my childhood, have sought after
6.  their godheads. Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar,
7.  king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city
8.  and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and
9.  the people that (were) in it went to ruin.
10. (Now) forasmuch as the shrines of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
11. and Sadarnunna I sought after and was worshipper of their godhead,
12. (and) that I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
13. I had ever in mind his great godhead—daily, without ceasing,
14. of Sin, Šamaš, Ištar, and Adda, so long as I am alive,
15. I (am) their votaress (both) in heaven and earth. My blessings,
16. the goodly things which they gave me, I (too) by day, night, month, and year, gave (back) to them.
17. I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
18. my two eyes were with him, in prayer and humility of face
19. was I bowed before them (and) thus (I prayed), &quot;May thy return
20. to thy city be (vouchsafed) to me, that the people, the black-headed,
21. may worship thy great godhead.&quot; For calming
22. the heart of my god and my goddess, a dress of fine wool, jewels,
23. silver, gold, a new shift, perfumes, sweet oil,
24. I applied not to my body, (but in) a torn shift
25. I went clothed, my goings-out were noiseless, I proclaimed
26. their praises : the glory of my city and of my goddess
27. was (ever) set in my heart, I kept watch upon them,
28. anything good of mine I did not omit, but carried it (ever) before them.
29. From the 20th year of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, that I was born (in)
30. until the 42nd year of Aššurbanipal, the 3rd year of Aššur-etillu-ili,
31. his son, the 21st year of Nabopolassar, the 43rd year of Nebuchadrezzar,
32. the 2nd year of Awēl-Marduk, the 4th year of Neriglissar,
33. in 95 years of the god Sin, king of the gods of heaven and earth,
34. (in) which I sought after the shrines of his great godhead,
35. (for) my good doings he looked upon me with a smile
36. he heard my prayers, he granted my saying, the wrath
37. of his heart calmed. Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin
38. which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had
39. regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and
40. Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship
41. he called, and the kingship of Sumer and Akkad
42. from the border of Egypt (on) the upper sea even to the lower sea
43. all the lands he entrusted hither
44. to his hands. My two hands I lifted up and to Sin, king of the gods,
45. reverently with imploration [(I prayed) thus, &quot;Nabu-na'id
46. (my) son, offspring of my womb, beloved of his mother,]
   Col. II.
1.  thou hast called him to the kingship, thou hast pronounced his name,
2.  at the command of thy great godhead may the great gods
3.  go at his two sides, may they make his enemies to fall,
4.  forget not, (but) make good E-h̬ul-h̬ul and the finishing of its foundation(?)&quot;.
5.  When in my dream, his two hands had been laid on, Sin, king of the gods,
6, 7. Spoke to me thus, &quot; With thee I will put into the hands of Nabuna'id, thy son, the return of the gods and the habitation of Harran;
8.  He shall build E-h̬ul-h̬ul, shall perfect its structure, (and) Harran
9.  more than (it was) before he shall perfect and restore it to its place.
10. The hand of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna
11. he shall clasp and cause them to enter E-hul-bul &quot;. The word of Sin,
12. king of the gods, which he spoke to me I honoured, and I myself saw (it fulfilled) ;
13. Nabu-na'id, (my) only son, offspring of my womb, the rites
14. forgotten of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and
15. Sadarnunna he perfected, E-h̬ul-h̬ul
16. anew he built and perfected its structure, Harran more
17. than before he perfected and restored it to its place ; the hand
18. of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna from
19. Šuanna his royal city he clasped, and in the midst of Harran
20. in E-h̬ul-h̬ul the abode of their hearts' ease with gladness
21. and rejoicing he let them dwell. What from former times Sin, king of the gods,
22. had not done and had not granted to anybody (he did) for the love of me
23. who had ever worshipped his godhead, laid hold on the hem of his robe—Sin, king of the gods,
24. uplifted my head and set upon me a good name in the land,
25. long days, years of heart's ease he multiplied upon me.
26. From the time of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, until the 9th year
27. of Nabu-na'id king of Babylon, the son, offspring of my womb
28. 104 years of happiness, with the reverence which Sin, king of the gods,
29. placed in me, he made me flourish, my own self: the sight of my two eyes
30. is clear, I am excellent in understanding, my hand and both feet are sound,
31. well-chosen are my words, meat and drink
32. agree with me, my flesh is goodly, glad is my heart.
33. My descendents to four generations from me flourishing in themselves
34. I have seen, I am fulfilled (with) offspring. O Sin, king of the gods, for favour
35. thou hast looked upon me, thou hast lengthened my days: Nabuna'id, king of Babylon,
36. my son, to Sin my lord I have devoted him. So long as he is alive
37. let him not offend against thee; the genius of favour, genius of favour which (to be) with me
38. thou hast appointed and they have caused me to attain offspring, with him (too)
39. appoint (them), and wickedness and offence against thy great godhead
40. endure not, (but) let him worship thy great godhead. In the 21 years
41. of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, in the 43 years of Nebuchadrezzar,
42. son of Nabopolassar,a nd 4 years of Neriglissar, king of Babylon,
43. (when) they exercised the kingship, for 68 years
44. with all my heart I reverenced them, I kept watch over them,
45. Nabu-na'id (my) son, offspring of my womb, before Nebuchadrezzar
46. son of Nabopolassar and (before) Neriglissar, king of Babylon, I caused him to stand,
47. daytime and night he kept watch over them
48. what was pleasing to them he performed continually,
49. my name he made (to be) favourite in their sight, (and) like
50. [a daughtero of] their [own] they uplifted my head
   Col. III.
1.  I nourished (their spirits), and incense offering
2.  rich, of sweet savour,
3.  I appointed for them continually and
4.  laid ever before them.
5.  (Now) in the 9th year of Nabu-na'id,
6.  king of Babylon, the fate
7.  of herself carried her off, and
8.  Nabu-na'id, king of Babylon,
9.  (her) son, issue of her womb, . . . . . . . . . . .
10. her corpse entombed, and [robes]

16. they laid it in a secret place. [Oxen and]
17. sheep (especially) fattened he [slaughtered]
18. before it. He assembled [the people]
19. of Babylon and Borsippa, [with the people]
20. dwelling in far regions, [kings, princes, and]
21. governors, from [the border]
22. of Egypt on the Upper Sea
23. (even) to the Lower Sea he [made to come up],

<p>There is some uncertainty about the accuracy or interpretation of the
reigns given for the Assyrian kings Ashurbanipal and Ashur-etil-ilani.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Ashur-etil-ilani’s reign coincided with the last
4 years of Ashurbanipal [4, p. 138] [5, p. 57], however this would
mean that the total lengths of 95/104 years would be incorrect due to
double counting. Others disagree and believe the inscription does not
contain any error [6].</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is limited evidence to be completely certain about
the chronology of the last Assyrian kings [7, p. 220].</p>

<p>From Col. X [3, p. 107] see also [6, p. 311]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[As to the temples of the gods] whose storehouses [were empty?]
and where they had not established their residence [since…..],
Marduk, my lord, waited for me and entrusted me with the restoration
of the divine cults. He decreed by his pure utterance the appeasement
of the angry gods and my (re)establishment of their dwellings (as a
duty) for my rule. (Concerning) H̬arran (and) the Eh̬ulh̬ul, which had
been lying in ruins for 54 years because of its devastation by the
Medes (who) destroyed the sanctuaries, with the consent of the gods
the time for the reconciliation approached, 54 years, when Sîn should
return to his place. When he returned to his place, Sîn, the lord of
the tiara, remembered his lofty seat, and (as to) all the gods who
left his chapel with him, it is Marduk, the king of the gods, who
ordered their gathering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="key-information-5"><a class="header" href="#key-information-5">Key Information</a></h2>
<p>The temple in Harran was destroyed during the 16th year of Nabopolassar:</p>
<p><a href="orthodox/nabon24.html">Adad Guppi Stele</a> Col i Lines 6-9:
<code>Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and the people that (were) in it went to ruin.</code></p>
<p><a href="orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">Fall of Nineveh Chronicle</a> Lines 58, 63-64:
<code>The sixteenth year: ... The king of Akkad reached Harran and [...] he captured the city. He carried off the vast booty of the city and the temple.</code></p>
<p>Later the <a href="orthodox/nabon24.html">Adad Guppi Stele</a> Col i Lines 37-40 says:
<code>Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship</code>.</p>
<p>According to Tadmor the inscription therefore counts 54 years from the
16th year of Nabopolassar to the accession of Nabonidus [1, p. 355]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 54 years are counted from 610, the sixteenth year of Nabopalassar
(when Sin “was angry with his city and his house and went up to
heaven”), to 556, the accession year of Nabunaid. The special
importance attached to the period of 54 years should not be
surprising; it represents, as Professor A. Sachs kindly informs me,
the complete cycle of the moon (i.e., three 18 year cycles).
Accordingly, “Sin’s returning to his place” would mean that the moon
cycle was completed. I believe that this coincidence — Nabunaid’s
coming to the throne exactly 54 years after the destruction of Harran
— was interpreted as a most favorable omen, that the moon-god had
become reconciled.</p>

<p>This would indicate that Psamtik ruled an even number of complete
years, but we cannot suppose that Psamtik I died on the last day of
the year; it is evident that he died in the fifty-fifth year of his

death, included in the first year of his successor, Necho. It is thus
clear that the years of the king’s reign in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty
began on New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>Psamtik II and Apries [1, p. 36]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psammis reigned only six years. He attacked Ethiopia, and died almost
directly afterwards. Apries, his son, succeeded him upon the throne,
who, excepting Psammetichus, his greatgrandfather, was the most
prosperous of all the kings that ever ruled over Egypt. The length of
his reign was twenty-five years,</p>

<p>Amasis: [1, p. 59]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped at the mouth of the Nile,
called the Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For Cambyses, when he went up
against Egypt, found Amasis no longer in life: he had died after
ruling Egypt forty and four years, during all which time no great
misfortune had befallen him.</p>

<p>Psammenitus: [1, p. 62]:</p>

<p>There are three different sources for Manetho concerning the 26th
dynasty; one from Africanus, and two from Eusebius [2, p. 171]:</p>
<pre><code>According to Africanus.

The Twenty-sixth Dynasty consisted of nine kings of Sais.
1. Stephinatês, for 7 years.
2. Nechepsôs, for 6 years.
3. Nechaô, for 8 years.
4. Psammêtichus, for 54 years.
5. Nechaô the Second, for 6 years: he took Jerusalem, and led King Iôachaz captive into Egypt.
6. Psammuthis the Second, for 6 years.
7. Uaphris [Apries], for 19 years: the remnant of the Jews fled to him, when Jerusalem was captured by the Assyrians.
8. Amôsis, for 44 years.
9. Psammecheritês, for 6 months.
Total, 150 years 6 months.

<p>We can see that Herodotus and the Egyptian Stelae in agreement with the
exception of Apries, although Herodotus is not necessarily incorrect;
Apries did not die in his 20th year, but rather entered into a
co-regency with Amasis, ruling together for at least 3 further years

<p>This chapter will look at the chronology of the Kingdom of Judah before
and up to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II.</p>
<p>By doing so I will indirectly answer the second question - why is there
is a dispute between the 587 BC and 586 BC dates?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Babylonian records describing the destruction of Jerusalem by the
army of Nebuchadnezzar have not been found. As a consequence, all
dates for that event must be derived from the scriptural record, as
tied to the last events prior to the destruction that are described in
the Babylonian archives. These are the Battle of Carchemish in 605 bc
and the initial capture of the city and its ruler Jehoiachin in the
spring of 597 bc.1 The time between the earlier of these two events
and the final destruction of Jerusalem was less than twenty years.
Since the period is fairly well documented in the Scriptures, it might
be expected that it would not be difficult to establish the year in
which the city was destroyed and the Babylonian Exile began.<br><br>
Such, however, has not been the case. Although the Scriptures state
that the end came in the fourth month of the eleventh year of
Zedekiah, scholars are divided on whether this refers to 586 bc or 587
bc. Jeremy Hughes listed eleven scholars who preferred the first date
and eleven who preferred the second.2 Edwin Thiele was among those
preferring 586, and this seems to be the date most widely used in the
popular literature. However, to Hughes’s list of those favoring 587
should be added the names of Donald Wiseman and Kenneth Kitchen. [1,

<p>At first it would appear that there are significant contradictions, both
internally within the Bible, and when synchronising with the Babylonian
chronicles. Some of the main issues include:</p>
<h2 id="battle-of-carchemish-1"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-1">Battle of Carchemish</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The 4th year of Jehoiakim = 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah
25:1)</li>
<li>Pharaoh Necho was defeated at Carchemish in the 4th year of
Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 46:2)</li>
<li>(Between month I-V) 21st year of Nabopolassar (= accession year of
Nebuchadnezzar) Egypt was defeated at Carchemish (<a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">Nebuchadnezzar
Chronicle / BM 21946 Obv. 1-10</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Was the 4th year of Jehoiakim (and therefore the battle of Carchemish)
in the accession or 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar?</p>
<h2 id="second-siege-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#second-siege-of-jerusalem">Second Siege of Jerusalem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Jehoiachin taken captive in the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings
24:12)</li>
<li>Nebuchadnezzar took 3023 Jews into exile in his 7th year (Jeremiah
52:28)</li>
<li>Nebuchadnezzar seized the king of Judah on 2/XII of his 7th year
(<a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle / BM 21946
Rev. 11-12</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Was Jehoiachin (and other captives) taken in the 7th or 8th year of
Nebuchadnezzar?</p>
<h2 id="third-siege-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#third-siege-of-jerusalem">Third Siege of Jerusalem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>On 7th (or 10th) day, month V in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:8) (Jeremiah 25:12) and
took Jews into exile.</li>
<li>In the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 people were taken into exile
(Jeremiah 52:29).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Babylonians did not break into the city until the 19th year of
Nebuchadnezzar, then why does Jeremiah only list captives as being taken
in the 18th year (and not the 19th)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In working out the chronology of a nation, a primary requisite is that
the chronological procedure of that nation be understood. The
following items must be definitely established: (1) the year from
which a king began to count the years of his reign—whether from the
time of his actual accession, from the following year, or from some
other time; (2) the time of the calendar year when a king began to
count his reign; (3) the method according to which a scribe of one
nation reckoned the years of a king of a neighboring state, whether
according to the system used in his nation or according to that of the
neighbor; (4) whether or not the nation made use of coregencies,
whether or not several rival rulers might have been reigning at the
same time, and whether interregna occurred; (5) whether during the
period under review a uniform system was followed, or whether
variations took place; and, finally, (6) some absolute date during the
period in question from which the years can be figured backward and
forward so that the full chronological pattern might be secured. An
understanding of each of the above items is necessary to a correct
reconstruction of the chronologies of Israel and Judah, for unless one
is acquainted with the type of chronological procedure in use, a wrong
interpretation is likely to be placed on the available data and cause
an erroneous pattern to ensue. [1, p. 43]</p>

<p>In Assyria, Babylon, and Persia when a king first came to the throne,
the year was usually called the king’s accession year, but not till
the first day of the first month of the next new year did the king
begin reckoning events in his own first year. This system of reckoning
is called the accession year system, or postdating. [1, p. 43]</p>

<p>Whilst we know the Babylonians began their calendar year at Nisanu in
Spring (<a href="judean/../introduction/calendar.html">see Calendar</a>), the situation in
Judah is more complex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the Hebrews there were two calendar years, one beginning with
Nisan in the spring and the other with Tishri in the fall. With which
of these months did the Hebrews begin reckoning their regnal years?
And did both Israel and Judah follow the same practice? [1, p. 44]</p>

<p>No consensus has yet been reached whether the Judean kings regnal years
were reckoned from Nisan or Tishri [2].</p>

<p><sup>* The Watchtower does believe that Jerusalem was captured in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th regnal year [10, pp. 481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR], but
uses a very different system to date this on the Julian calendar - this
is discussed in <a href="judean/solutions/../../watchtower/README.html">Chapter 4</a>.</sup></p>
<p>We will see that all of the proposed solutions fail to definitively
satisfy all the chronological data, and therefore we are unable to give
a certain date for the destruction of Jerusalem:</p>

<p>It was sometime in Sivan/Tammuz 609 that the “great Egyptian Army”
(B.M. 21901, rev. 1. 66), setting out to rescue Assurubalit II in

<p>Postulating a Nisan-to-Nisan year in Judah one has, consequently, to
equate the 4th year of Jehoiakim with the accession year of
Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 25:1) rather than with the Babylonian king’s
first full year. The <em>hapax eiremenon</em> הראשנית השנה in Jer. 25:1 would
refer therefore to the rēš šarrǔti (= accession year) of
Nebuchadnezzar. [2, p. 227]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The three years of Jehoiakim’s submission to Babylon before he
rebelled would be then (Judean years): 604/3-602/1. The revolt in 601
might have been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt, whose new
strength is evident from the defeat inflicted by Necho on the
attacking armies of Babylon in that year. The account of Josephus
(Ant. x, 87) of a new Babylonian campaign to Judah in Jehoiakim’s 8th
and Nebuchadnezzar’s 4th year and the tribute paid to Babylon accords
with the new Babylonian chronicle, which tells of a submission of

<p>However no attempt at reconciling Daniel 1:1 appears to have been made
(with which it would contradict since it says Nebuchadnezzar besieged
Jerusalem in the 3rd year rather than 5th of Jehoiakim).</p>

<p>Tadmor’s synchronistic table lists the siege of Jerusalem and capture of
Jehoiachin as 2/XII of Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year, based on <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> Rev. 11-13. But he notes
that the captives were taken, and that Zedekiah’s accession were at the
beginning in the new year (Nisan, Nebuchadnezzar year 8) - which would
match 2 Kings 24:12, and 2 Chronicles 36:10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statements in Jer. 52:28 and 52:29 that 3023 Judeans had been
exiled in the 7th and 18th (instead of the correct 8th and 19th) years
of Nebuchadnezzar seem to derive from the same tradition, but no
satisfactory explanation of its origin has yet been offered. [2, p.

<h3 id="battle-of-megiddo-1"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-megiddo-1">Battle of Megiddo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thiele placed the Josiah-Neco confrontation in the 17th year of
Nabopolassar (609 BC). But then he added that Josiah perished in the
month of Tammuz (June–July) as Chronicles 3:66–67 gives that month as
the beginning of the Assyrian-Egyptian counterattack against Haran.2
This decision resulted in his placing the three-month reign of
Jehoahaz (2 Kings 23:31) from Tammuz (June–July) to sometime in
September or October, yet neither is correct.<br><br> Thiele failed to
consider logistics. It could have easily taken as much as several
months for Neco to regroup and rest his troops after the Battle of
Megiddo, then march his massive army some 425± miles over often rugged
to mountainous terrain in order to join with the Assyrian’s under
Ashur-uballit II. After again resting his soldiers (they must be fit
to fight man-to-man with swords, spears and bows), the two kings must
lay out battle plans, recross the Euphrates River, march their immense
joint forces some 70 miles to Haran, and finally launch the attack.
Thus, Josiah could hardly have been killed in the month of Tammuz.
Accordingly, he was slain months earlier.<br><br> Moreover, charting
the data quickly clarifies the matter (see next page and Chart 5c).
From this, it will be seen that Josiah had to have died near mid-March
(Adar) but shortly before Nisan 1 of 609 BC (Tuesday, March 20th,
Gregorian). [2, p. 188]</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-and-subjugation-of-judah"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-and-subjugation-of-judah">Battle of Carchemish and Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it will be observed that the fourth year of Jehoiakim is placed
in the year of the Battle of Carchemish (605 BC) in agreement with
Jer. 46:2. However, Jer. 25:1 also speaks of the fourth year of
Jehoiakim saying: “that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon” (see diagram on page 126). How may this apparent discrepancy
be reconciled?<br><br> The Hebrew words for “first year” in Jer. 25:1
are השנה הראשנית (hashshanah haroshniyth). Not being found elsewhere
in Scripture, the phrase is unique and the feminine singular form of
the adjective modifying the word “year” can mean either “first or
beginning”. Thus the phrase in Jer. 25:1 is seen as not referring to
Nebuchadnezzar’s official first year but to his initial year on the
throne, the year of his accession. [2, p. 125]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones places Nebuchadnezzar’s first invasion of Judah in the 3rd year of
Jehoiakim as stated in Daniel 1:1, which would actually be in the year
prior to Nebuchadnezzar’s accession. He believes this is necessary to
fit 3 years of Daniel’s training (Daniel 1:5):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in resolving this issue revolves around the fact that
it simply would not be possible that Daniel and his three friends
could be so highly elevated in the affairs of the government of
Babylonia in chapter 2 (Dan. 2:48, 49) and afterward still have to
appear before King Nebuchadnezzar to obtain his approval by proving
their abilities “to stand in the king’s palace” (Dan. 1:4, 18–20) as
though they were yet mere students. But such would be the case were
the happenings of chapter 2 imbedded somewhere within the three-year
time frame of chapter 1. Accordingly, the context of chapter 2 clearly
follows <em>after</em> chapter 1 chronologically. Since chapter 1 encompasses
most of a three year span (cp. vv. 4, 5, 18), then the events in
chapter 2 must have occurred after Daniel’s schooling. Thus, the
second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign must take place after Daniel’s
and the other princes of Judah’s “graduation”. [2, p. 189]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It follows then that Daniel 1:1 does not conflict with Jeremiah 25:1
as is often claimed. Observe that Daniel 1:1 does not say that the
third year of the reign of Jehoiakim is the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. As illustrated, such would be impossible from
the data in chapter 1 when compared to 2:1 which is said to occur in
Nebuchadnezzar’s second year of dominion. Moreover, Daniel 1:1 is
merely a statement of identification, i.e., the Nebuchadnezzar who
came and besieged Jerusalem in Jehoiakim’s third year is the same man
who ascended to the throne and became sole rex the following year
(Jer. 25:1). The apparent contradiction has been resolved by simply
allowing the Scriptures to speak for themselves, apart from profane
materials. [2, p. 190]</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="criticism"><a class="header" href="#criticism">Criticism</a></h4>
<p>Against Jones’ dating for Daniel 1:1 Ian Foley argues [3, p. 31]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jones (2004, 189) takes the view that the only possible solution to
this first problem is that Nebuchadnezzar must have besieged Jerusalem
and Daniel must have been exiled in 606 BC. However, this solution
creates as many problems as it solves because (1) Nebuchadnezzar was
not yet king in 606 BC. (However, he was crown prince, and perhaps the
title of “king” could be used), (2) Jones uses nonaccession year
reckoning for the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar so that his second
year is 604 BC, and it is not clear why he did not use accession year
reckoning to make Nebuchadnezzar’s second year 603 BC. (3) Until the
defeat of the Egyptians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, there
is strong evidence that Egypt controlled Judah and Palestine and that
Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions prior to that involved conflict with
Egypt in Syria and further north, and (4) there are other solutions to
the two problems that would satisfy Jones’s view of biblical
inspiration without the need to propose Daniel’s exile in 606 BC.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-1"><a class="header" href="#captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-1">Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the Hebrew account seems to conflict with the Babylonian
record. It declares that the second deportation which brought
Jehoiachin to Babylon, whereupon Zedekiah was placed on the throne in
Jerusalem, occurred in the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar.<br><br> The
“discrepancy” resolves itself when it is seen that the Babylonian
account has Jerusalem falling into their hands on 2 Adar.2 Now Adar is
the 12th and final month of the 7th year. It naturally follows that
selecting a vassal, establishing a new government, cutting in pieces
the gold vessels in the Temple (2 Kings 24:13) and preparing the vast
booty for transport before returning to Babylon requires time.
Moreover, 2 Kings 24:14–16 tells us that the populace was divided and
all the leaders, the most affluent, the surviving warriors of valor,
masons, smiths, and carpenters – at least 10,000 of the cream of
Judah’s citizenry – were separated from the poorest of the common
people and then carried away to the Chaldean homeland. Such an
undertaking would also have required time. <br><br> Indeed, the Hebrew
Text reveals the precise length of that interval! In 2 Chron. 36:9–10
we learn that, after a reign of three months and ten days, “when the
year was expired” Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) was brought to Babylon. Hence,
this very brief but undefined time after 1 Nisan of the next year
would fall in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar [2, p. 126]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the deportations at the end of Jeremiah, in the 7th and 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, inconceivably, the later portion of Jeremiah 52 seems to record
the fall of Jerusalem as having taken place in the 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar rather than in his 19th (which was Zedekiah’s 11th). To
begin with, these verses are not recorded in 2 Kings 25. Jeremiah
52:28–34 seems to be an addendum – possibly written by Ezra in Babylon
after Jeremiah’s death (It is noteworthy that it is not part of the
text of the LXX.).<br><br> Being so small a number, most suppose
verses 28–30 are referring to only the adult males of importance. Yet,
how can we conclude that only 4,600 Jews were carried away in all of
Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions when we know at least 10,000 of
prominence were carried away at one time with Jeconiah in 597 BC (2
Kings 24:12–16)?<br><br> Indeed, the very fact that 2 Kings 24:12–16
records the removal of these 10,000 in the eighth year of
Nebuchadnezzar demands that Jer. 52:28 where 3,023 were said to have
been carried away in that monarch’s seventh year is referring to a
completely separate event. The differing numbers should alert us that
it is not merely a matter of attempting to reconcile Nebuchadnezzar’s
seventh with his eighth year by “Hebrew reckoning” or “Babylonian
reckoning” that is in view here. Two different happenings are before
us.<br><br> It follows that if these are not equivalent, and thus
should not be associated, then the same is true for trying to force
the “18th year” of Jer. 52:29 to match the “19th year” of Jer. 52:12
and 2 Kings 25:8. Hence, it seems most reasonable to conclude with
Ussher that there were three significant deportations – in 606 BC
(when Nebuchadnezzar was general-of-the-army and crown prince,
Dan.1:1), as well as his 8th, and 19th regnal years — which are to be
distinguished from the minor ones that Jer. 52:28–30 lists in his 7th,
18th, and 23rd years. These latter, then, were likely added after the
fact to complete the historical record.<br><br> If so, the first minor
deportation, reported by Jeremiah to have transpired in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year, would have been those seized by the bands
of Chaldeans, Syrians, etc. whom the king of Babylon sent against
Judah prior to his coming (2 Kings 24:2). That in the 18th year would
correspond to when the Chaldeans broke off the siege of Jerusalem to
meet Pharaoh’s approaching army. Afterward, it may have been deemed
prudent to march the swelling number of Egyptian and Jewish prisoners
in the camp off to Babylon. [2, p. 127]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="release-of-jehoiachin-1"><a class="header" href="#release-of-jehoiachin-1">Release of Jehoiachin</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, in the first year of his reign, Evil Merodach (Amel-Marduk),
Nebuchadnezzar’s son and successor, liberated Jehoiachin from prison
and raised him to a position of honor at the palace (562 BC, the 18th
Jubilee — Jer. 52:31–34). Evil Merodach’s kind, respectful treatment
of Jehoiachin after 37 years’ imprisonment further substantiates the
correctness of the above assertions. [2, p. 128]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones appears to be counting 37 years on the Anno Mundi (Year After
Creation) calendar which begins its new year in Tishri.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resulted in fixing the year of “the captivity” as AM 3407. The
relevant Scriptures relating to the reigns of the kings of Judah were
then charted in terms of AM years. This resulted in fixing the year of
“the captivity” as AM 3407. Inclusively numbering 37 years from this
first year of Jeconiah’s (Jehoiachin) captivity brought me to 3443 AM,
the first year of the reign of Evil-merodach, son and successor of
Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 25:27, cp. 2 Kings 24:12, 15). Counting back
from 3443 AM, 3418 was found to be Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year – the
very year the Scriptures say he razed Jerusalem (Jer. 52:12–15). As
stated above, this destruction took place in Zedekiah’s 11th year (2
Kings 25:1–7), thus confirming the synchronization of Judah and
Babylon in 3418. [2, p. 309]</p>

<p>According to <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">BM 21901</a> line 66,
the Egyptian army crossed the river Euphrates in Tammuz (IV) of
Nabopolassar’s 17th year. Malamat therefore argues that the battle of
Megiddo took place in Sivan (III):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josiah evidently died in Sivan or possibly at the start of Tammuz, as
indicated by correlating the biblical account (2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chron.
35:20-23) with that of the Babylonian Chronicle of Nabopolassar,
father of Nebuchadnezzar. The Bible relates that Necho, when
intercepted by Josiah at Megiddo, was in great haste northward (‘for
God commanded me to make haste’; 2 Chron. 35:21), while the Babylonian
source records that ‘a large Egyptian army’, on its way to aid the
allied Assyrians against the Babylonian forces, had already crossed
the Euphrates in Tammuz. Assuming that the Egyptian army marched at
the considerable rate of 35 km a day, or even more (remembering that
this took place during the long summer days), it could have covered
the distance between Megiddo and Carchemish (over 500 km) in about two
weeks. Thus, the Battle of Megiddo probably occurred sometime between
early Sivan and early Tammuz. [3, p. 139]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But note now that the Egyptians required almost a month, rather than
two weeks, to cover the distance to the river (which they crossed in
Tammuz 609 B.C.), for the actual distance between Megiddo and
Carchemish is about 650 km, and the advance of the rushing Egyptian
army should be estimated at about 25-30 km per diem. [2, p. 125]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the march, and therefore timing of the battle of Megiddo
is significant because it has an impact on the likelihood of a Tishri to
Tishri year in Judah, as explained by Clines [4, p. 29]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In determining the date of his [Jehoiakim’s] accession, the events
which must be brought into relationship are: <br>1. Battle of Megiddo,
death of Josiah, accession of Jehoahaz. <br>2. March of Egyptians from
Megiddo to Euphrates. <br>3. Egyptian crossing of Euphrates for attack
on Harran. <br>4. Capture of Jehoahaz and accession of Jehoiakim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The chronological data are twofold: <br>a. No. 3 occurred in Tammuz
(25 June-23 July), 609 (BM 21901, Rev. 66-67). <br>b. ‘Three months’
intervened between No. 1 and No. 4 (2 Kings 23:31; 2 Chr. 36:2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Clines believes it is more likely that Josiah died, Jehoahaz
ruled for 3 months, and then Jehoiakim acceded to the throne before
Tishri 1, rather than after it, and as such this would move his
accession year back by one. If this were the case it would cause a
conflict since Jehoiakim would have died in his 12th rather than 11th
year as described in 2 Kings 23:36 and 2 Chronicles 36:5. [4, p. 32]</p>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-3"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-3">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<p>According to <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM 21946</a> Obv. 1-10
the battle of Carchemish took place sometime during the first 4 months
of Nabopolassar’s 21st year, in Malamat’s chronology this would
correspond to Jehoiakim’s 3rd year, rather than his 4th as described in
Jeremiah 46:2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the Babylonian source, see <em>CCK</em>, pp. 66ff. (BM 21946). Jer. 46:2
places the Battle of Carchemish in Jehoiakim’s fourth regnal year, the
only substantial instance of a date conflicting with our Tishri
reckoning, which would put this battle in his third year (cf. the
Chronological Table). See <em>IEJ</em> XVIII 1968, p. 147, n. 21, where we
have also cited HORN’s suggestion to reconcile the difficulty here by
attributing this date to the time of the oracular utterance rather
than to the battle itself. Although problematic, this might find
support in Jer. 36:1-2, where the date of the Prophet’s first scroll,
which recorded <em>inter alia</em> Oracles on the Nations, is fixed in
Jehoiakim’s fourth regnal year. The chronological notation at the head
of the Oracles on the Nations in Jer. 46:2 thus may well have been
harmonized with this. WEIPPERT (<em>Edom</em>, p. 653, n. 1238) assumes that
the Battle of Carchemish and the subsequent Babylonian campaign, which
latter took place in the winter of 605/604 B.C., after the
enthronement of Nebuchadnezzar. were regarded in Judah as one
continuous military episode, which thus would have fallen already in
Jehoiakim’s fourth regnal year; but Jeremiah’s prophecy specifically
deals with the defeat of “the army of Pharaoh Necho” which no longer
took part in events half a year after the Battle of Carchemish. [2,
p. 127]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah-1"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah-1">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<p>Malamat does not offer a definitive date for Nebuchadnezzar’s
subjugation of Judah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Babylonian subjugation of Judah was not long in coming. The exact
date is still a matter of controversy, and even Nebuchadnezzar’s
Chronicle is indefinite. Military campaigns to the West are recorded
for each of the years between 605 and 601 B.C., but no specific names
of subjected states are mentioned (except Ashkelon). [2, p. 129]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first solution (corresponding to Obv. line 8 of <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a>) is the only one that works
with Jehoiakim’s 3rd year as per Daniel 1:1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) Judah was conquered immediately after the Egypdan defeat at the
Battle of Carchemish. This is supported by the opening of the Book of
Daniel (1:1-4) relating the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in
the third year of Jehoiakim (see Chronological Table), the looting of
“vessels of the house of God”, and the exiling of certain Judeans.
Further the last datum is in accord with a tradition related by
Josephus (<em>Ant</em>. X; 11, 1; <em>Contra Apionem</em> I, 19), that Judean
captives; amongst others, were carried off to Babylon after the
victory at Carchemish. In another passage (Ant. X, 6, 1), Josephus
even specifies that at this same time Nebuchadnezzar conquered all the
lands of the West as far as Pelusium on the border of Egypt—but he
explicitely adds: “except the land of Judah”; It is difficult,
however, to rely upon the chronological accuracy of these traditions
(which apparently refer to events occurring several years later).
Though Josephus’s data largely agree with those of the Babylonian
Chronicle, the Chronicle itself does not bear out any widespread
conquests in the West while Nebuchadnezzar was still Crown Prince.
Immediately after the victory at Carchemish, as we now know,
Nebuchadnezzar conquered only the “entire land of Ha[ma]th”, and not
the “entire land of Hatti” (that is, Syria-Palestine), as formerly
read. [2, p. 129]</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="issues"><a class="header" href="#issues">Issues</a></h4>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar would not yet be King until later in that year, so Daniel
1:1 would need to be read proleptically [5, p. 183] [4, p. 23].</p>
<p>Clines questions whether there is enough time between the battle of
Carchemish and Nebuchadnezzar’s return to Babylon (month VI) following
Nabopolassar’s death [5, p. 187]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It involves the interposition of a Babylonian march to Jerusalem from
Hamath (no place further south is mentioned in the Babylonian
Chronicle) and a siege of the city in the short interval between
May-June (Carchemish) and c. August 25 (news of Nabopolassar’s death).
Very little time, if any, would be available for the siege itself,
when the days spent in marching are reckoned up (see below, under
II.2). We do not know where Nebuchadrezzar was when he received news
of his father’s death, but it must be recalled that only 3 weeks
elapsed between Nabopolassar’s death and Nebuchadrazzar’s arrival in
Babylon. [4, p. 24]</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h4>
<p>Alternatively Malamat suggests in the 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Obv.
15-17) [2, p. 130]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b) Judah submitted a year later, when Nebuchadnezzar devastated
Ashkelon, in Kislev of his first regnal year (December 604 B.C.). This
date corresponds exactly with the ninth month of the fifth regnal year
of Jehoiakim, when a general day of fasting was proclaimed in
Jerusalem (Jer. 36:9 ff.; see the Chronological Table). Jeremiah’s
foreboding words, brought before an emergency council of ministers on
the fastday, warned of the impending national calamity— the full drama
of which we can trace today by means of the Babylonian Chronicle. But
Jehoiakim, belittling Jeremiah’s warning “that the king of Babylon
will certainly come and destroy this land” (Jer. 36:29), burned the
Prophet’s scroll of doom, which leads to the conclusion that Judah at
this time was still not subdued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in his 2nd year (Obv. 21-23)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>c) The submission of Judah may have occurred only in the autumn or
winter of 603 B.C., during Nebuchadnezzar’s campaign in his second
regnal year. Unfortunately, the broken state of the Babylonian tablet
here does not enable us to confirm this. In this campaign, which was
certainly to the West, the Babylonian king set out in the month of
Iyyar with a “mighty army” supported by siege machines, indicating
that strong opposition was anticipated. Nebuchadnezzar was most
probably seeking to subdue all Philistia and gain control of Judah—all
as a prelude to his ultimate goal—the conquest of Egypt, his
arch-rival. If this be the case, the lacuna here is to be restored
with the conquest of a specific city in Philistia, such as Ashdod,
Ekron or more probably Gaza (cf. Jer. 25:20; 47:5; Zeph. 2:4); the
subsequent missing section of the tablet might then relate to the
submission of Jehoiakim (cf. II Chron. 36:6-7; Dan. 1:1-2—both
apparently relating to this event).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Dan. 1:1, with the slight emendation of ‘In the <em>third</em> year’ to
‘In the <em>sixth</em> year’ (שש &lt; שלוש) of the reign of Jehoiakim, the
date of Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem would correspond with that
suggested above for the subjugation of Judah, i.e. the autumn or
winter of 603 B.C. [3, p. 142]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But these would be in the 5th or 6th year of Jehoiakim, so do not fit
Daniel 1:1, and they also take place after Nebuchadnezzar
<code>marched about victoriously in Hattu</code> in his accession year (Obv. Line
12-14).</p>
<h3 id="captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-2"><a class="header" href="#captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-2">Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah</a></h3>
<p>Malamat attempts to reconcile the differing dates and numbers of exiles
between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25, by viewing them as separate
events:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biblical sources on the exile of Jehoiachin are in outward
contradiction, in both the extent of the exile and its exact date.
According to II Kings 24, the exile encompassed 10,000 (<em>vs</em>. 14) or
7,000 (<em>vs</em>. 16) persons, mostly military, to either of which we must
add a thousand armourers and sappers. This mass exile, headed by
Jehoiachin and his entourage, occurred according to this source in the
eight year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (<em>vs</em>. 12), the year beginning on
1 Nisan 597 B.C.—at least a month after the surrender of Jerusalem.
Moreover, II Chronicles 34:10 also implies that Jehoiachin was exiled
around the time of the civil new year, and that Nebuchadnezzar had
already returned to his capital, surely for the annual festivities.
But according to the list of exiles in Jeremiah 52 (based undoubtedly
on some official source), a mere 3,023 “Jews” were exiled—in the
<em>seventh</em> year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (<em>vs</em> 28). These have
generally been regarded as contradicting traditions on one and the
same matter, or it has been thought that different chronological
systems were employed in the Book of Kings and in Jeremiah 52,
respectively —though even then the numbers for the deportees disagree.
The discrepancies between the two sources can be reconciled, however,
by proposing that the exile evolved in two successive deportations:
<br><br> a) The first phase (already intimated in Jer. 13:18-19) was a
limited deportation prior to or upon the surrender of Jerusalem —still
in Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh year (Jer. 52:28). The particular
appellative here, “Jews”—implying the provincial element of Judah—is
brought into perspective by the designation “from Jerusalem”, applied
to the exiles deported during the final siege, in Nebuchadnezzar’s
18th year (<em>vs</em>. 29; and see the Chronological Table). Several years
after the destruction of Jerusalem, in Nebuchadnezzar’s 23rd year, the
deportees are once again, and quite appropriately, called “Jews”
(<em>vs</em>. 30). <br><br> b) The second, principal phase of the exile,
described in the Book of Kings, comprised the cream of Jerusalem and
thousands of her defenders, including the armourers and sappers
specifically mentioned as exiled from the capital (Jer. 24:1; 29:2).
The organization of this mass exile surely necessitated several weeks
from the time of the surrender of the city, on 2 Adar, and thus it
would have fallen only in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighth regnal year, by
which time he had already left the country.</p>

<p>Thiele states that Josiah was killed at Megiddo in Tammuz (IV),
afterwards Jehoahaz rules for 3 months into Tishri (month VII) [2, p.
182]. He does not appear to explain how the Egyptian army made the ~400

<blockquote>
<p>Nabopolassar stayed at home in his twenty-first year, beginning with
Nisan, 605, but sent Nebuchadnezzar with the army against Carchemish.
A disastrous defeat was inflicted on the Egyptians. A remnant that
fled to Hamath was wiped out with the result that “Nebuchadnezzar
conquered the whole area of the Hatti-country.” This includes all of
Aram and the territory south to the borders of Egypt. Babylon rather
than Egypt was now the master in Palestine. This was the attack
mentioned in Daniel 1:1 that took place in the third year of Jehoiakim
and in which Daniel and his companions were taken to Babylon. It
should be noticed that this was the third year of Jehoiakim according
to Tishri reckoning, but the fourth year according to Nisan years as
mentioned in Jeremiah 46:2. [2, p. 183]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would unfortunately appear Thiele is referencing the earlier
translation of <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM 21946</a>, which
has Ḫatti-country in Obv. 8. However as noted by Malamat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Chronicle itself does not bear out any widespread conquests in the
West while Nebuchadnezzar was still Crown Prince. Immediately after
the victory at Carchemish, as we now know, Nebuchadnezzar conquered
only the “entire land of Ha[ma]th”, and not the “entire land of
Hatti” (that is, Syria-Palestine), as formerly read. [4, p. 130]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Tadmor, Thiele interprets Jeremiah 25:1 as referring to
Nebuchadnezzar’s accession rather than first year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battle of Carchemish at the Euphrates in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim is now definitively dated by Babylonian evidence (B.M.
21946) in the twenty-first year of Nabopolassar, 605 B.C In Jeremiah
25:1 the fourth year of Jehoiakim is equated with “the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” Tadmor has pointed out that this השנה
הראשנית of Nebuchadnezzar refers not to his official first year but to
his initial year on the throne. the year of his accession. [2, p.
184]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biblical account places the capture of Jerusalem in the eighth
year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 24:12), but the Babylonian account
places it in the seventh year. The Babylonian account is in accord
with Nisan regnal years and the biblical account starts the years of
Nebuchadnezzar with Tishri. The last half of the Babylonian Nisan year
overlaps the first half of the Hebrew Tishri year. Thus Jerusalem fell
to Nebuchadnezzar in his seventh year according to his own reckoning
but in his eighth year according to the reckoning in Kings. The
overlap was from Tishri in the fall of598 to Nisan in the spring of
597. Since Jerusalem fell in Adar, the last month of the Babylonian
year, this was in the spring of 597. [2, p. 186]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The last event in the checkered history of the southern kingdom was
the siege and destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. This siege
began on the tenth day of the tenth month of Zedekiah’s ninth year (2
Kings 25:1; Jer. 39:1; 52:4; cf. Ezek. 24:1-2), 15 January 588. The
next year, in the midst of the siege, Jeremiah was imprisoned, this
being the tenth year of Zedekiah and synchronizing with the eighteenth
year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 32:1), 587. Famine prevailed, the city
was broken, and the king fled, on the ninth day of the fourth month of
Zedekiah’s eleventh year (2 Kings 25:2-3; Jer. 39:2; 52:5-7), 18 July
586. On the seventh day of the fifth month the final destruction of
the city began (2 Kings 25:8-10), 14 August 586. This was the
nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 25:8; Jer. 52:12), which
was from Nisan 586 to Nisan 585, Babylonian reckoning, or Tishri 587
to Tishri 586, Judean years. Gedaliah, who had been appointed by
Nebuchadnezzar as governor of the land, was slain in the seventh month
(2 Kings 25:22-25; Jer. 41:1-2). The month of Tishri began on 7
October 586. It must have been shortly after that, that the remnant
left by Nebuzaradan with Gedaliah took Jeremiah and forced him to
accompany them to Egypt (Jer. 43:2-7). Word of the fall of Jerusalem
reached the captives in Babylon on the fifth day of the tenth month of
the twelfth year of their captivity (Ezek. 33:21), 8 January 585.
Zedekiah’s reign thus was from 597 to 586. [2, p. 190]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thiele does not seem to offer any explanation for how the captives
described in Jeremiah 52:28-30 fit in with the sieges (there is no
reference in his scripture index [2, p. 253]).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that, according to the reckoning of Kings, the
thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin’s captivity was from Tishri 562, to
Tishri 561. But according to Ezekiel’s and Jeremiah’s method of
reckoning, the thirty-seventh year of the captivity would not begin
until Nisan 561. [2, p. 190]</p>

<h2 id="discussion-4"><a class="header" href="#discussion-4">Discussion</a></h2>
<h3 id="battle-of-megiddo-4"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-megiddo-4">Battle of Megiddo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Those, however, who believe that a civil year beginning in autumn was
used in Judah to reckon the regnal years of the kings, are forced to
assume that Jehoahaz was not deposed until after Tishri I (Sept. 21),
because data contained in the Babylonian Chronicles, not yet
discussed, make it certain that Jehoiakim, the successor of Jehoahaz,
began his first regnal year in 608, either in the spring or in the
autumn, and that his first year cannot have started in the autumn of
609. According to this reasoning the Battle of Megiddo cannot have
taken place earlier than in Tammuz, the same month in which the
Assyrian and Egyptian armies crossed the Euphrates. In no other way
could Jehoahaz have reigned for three months and still be deposed
after Tishri I. [2, p. 19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again this would appear to raise the question of whether there is enough
time for Neco and the Egyptian army to travel from Megiddo to Carchemish
before the end of Tammuz (month IV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The campaign against Haran by the Assyrians and Egyptians began with
the crossing of the Euphrates in Tamrnuz (June 25 to July 23) and
ended with their retreat in Elul (Aug. 23 to Sept. 20). This means
that the campaign could have begun as early as the end of June or as
late as the second half of July. The distance from Megiddo to
Carchemish is approximately 340 miles and must have taken the Egyptian
army nearly a month to cover. This leads to the conclusion that the
Battle of Megiddo could hardly have ended later than the middle of
June, if the advance toward Haran started in the latter part of
Tammuz. It could have been earlier, if the crossing of the Euphrates
took place in the early part of Tammuz. [2, p. 17]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-4"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-4">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In Jer 25:1, the 4th year of Jehoiakim of Judah is equated with the
1st year of Nebuchadnezzar. This was the autumn-to-autumn year
605/604. [2, p. 26]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The only problem text seems to be Jer 46:2, ’which states that the
Battle of Carchemish took place in the 4th year of Jehoiakim, which
according to the Jewish calendar was the year 605/604,
autumn-to-autumn. But we know now that the Battle of Carchemish took
place in the spring of 605, before Nabopolassar’s death. This
difficulty can be explained only in one of two ways: (I) Either the
passage of Jer 46:2 contains a scribal error made by the author,
compiler or a copyist, or (2) the date refers not to the battle itself
but rather to the time when the prophecy was issued. I therefore,
venture to suggest that Jer 46:1-2 be read in the following way: “The
word of Yahweh which came to Jeremiah the prophet, against the
nations; about Egypt: against the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt
(which had been at the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had defeated) in the 4th year of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.” If the portion of the
verse referring to the Battle of Carchemisch is considered a
parenthetical clause, all chronological difficulties are removed, and
this passage falls in line with the rest of the dated historical
statements of Jeremiah mentioning Nebuchadnezzar. <br><br> In this
case one has to assume that the parenthetical clause was inserted in
the introduction to Jeremiah’s message to point out that the prophetic
oracle was pronounced over the Egyptian army which had been badly
mauled several months before, perhaps as long ago as a year. It is
true that in this way the passage shows an artificial and unnatural
grammatical construction, for which reason this interpretation may not
appeal to many scholars, but one should at least admit the possibiIity
that the text can be interpreted in such a way that the chronological
difficulties, which otherwise exist, can be removed. That translators
from the LXX to our time have applied the date as referring to the
battle is no proof that the traditional reading is correct. Since
numerous parallels of similar parenthetical clauses have been
recognized in many other Biblical passages, this one need not be
rejected as an isolated case. [2, p. 25]</p>

<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah-2"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah-2">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<p>Horn does not appear to explain where the subjugation of Judah (2 Kings
24:1, Daniel 1:1) during Jehoiakim’s reign, would fit in.</p>
<h3 id="captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-4"><a class="header" href="#captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-4">Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This double reckoning of Nebuchadnezzar’s regnal years by the
Babylonian and Jewish annalists accounts for the apparent discrepancy
between the data with regard to the date of Jehoiachin’s capture; for
the Babylonian Chronicles place this event in the 7th year of
Nebuchadnezzar, while 2 Ki 24:12 puts it in the 8th year. The 7th year
of Nebuchadnezzar according to the Babylonian spring calendar lasted
from March 27, 598 to April 12, 597, but according to the Jewish
autumn calendar it had already ended in the autumn of 598, when
Nebuchadnezzar’s 8th year had begun. Hence, both documents, the
Babylonian Chronicles as well as 2 Ki 24:12, contain accurate
information in spite of their apparent contradictions. [2, p. 25]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fall and final destruction of Jerusalem is dated in 2 Ki 25:8 and
in Jer 52:12 in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, which coincided with
the 11th year of Zedekiah of Judah (2 Ki 25:2; Jer 39:2; 52:5). That
year was the autumn-to-autumn year 587/586, as has already been
pointed out.<br><br> The two deportations of Jews recorded in Jer
52:28-30 which took place in the 7th and 18th years of Nebuchadnezzar
must have been secondary and minor deportations, and cannot refer to
deportations which took place after Jehoiachin’s capture in 597 and
after the fall and destruction of Jerusalem in 586, because of the
small number of deportees. For the deportation of 597 our sources in 2
Ki 24:14 and 16 mention 10,000 and 8,000 deportees respectively.
Therefore, the deportation of 3,023 according to Jer 52:28 in the
preceding year (the 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 599/598,
autumn-to-autumn) must have been in connection with the harassment of
Jehoiakim by “bands of the Chaldeans” to which 2 Ki 24:2 refers [2,
p. 26].</p>

<p>Albright dates the death of Josiah at Megiddo to Spring of
Nabopolassar’s 17th year, just prior to the Egyptian attack on Harran in
month IV.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I see no escape from dating the Battle of Megiddo in the spring
of 609, since there was a massive Egyptian attack on Harran later that
summer, whereas not a word is said about Egyptian military movements
in 608. [2, p. 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-5"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-5">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<p>Jeremiah 46:2 “Necho king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on
the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year
of Jehoiakim” would now make sense since while it actually took place
while Nebuchadnezzar was crown prince, he was considered in the West as
king a year earlier.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 25:1 “the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah,
which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar” would therefore refer
actually to Nebuchadnezzar’s accession year.</p>
<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah-3"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah-3">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<p>Albright seems to think that Judah was not occupied until after the
capture of Ashkelon (<a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM 21946</a>
Obv. 18), perhaps in the 2nd year of Nebuchadnezzar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is most unlikely that the Chaldaeans occupied Judah before the
capture and destruction of Ascalon in December, 604, and since the
next two years were apparently devoted to continued fighting in
Greater Syria, I should consider it unlikely that Judah was actually
invaded until some time in 603/2. [2, p. 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t explain Obv. 17 where
<code>All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their vast tribute.</code>
in the first year, or how Daniel 1:1 would fit in here (it would be the
6th year of Jehoiakim).</p>
<h3 id="captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-5"><a class="header" href="#captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-5">Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result of the new Chronicle I have slightly changed my own
interpretation of the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar given throughout
Jeremiah except in the passage 52:28-30, which does not appear at all
in the Western recension and was, therefore, probably inserted later
in Babylonia. The Jeremianic regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar are all
one year too high, from the Babylonian point of view: the Battle of
Carchemish was actually fought while he was still crown prince, and
the two falls of Jerusalem were in his seventh and eighteenth years,
not in the eighth and nineteenth. This is correctly stated in the
interpolated passage which we have mentioned. It is well known that
there was a difference of a year in two methods of reckoning the reign
of Sennacherib, so I propose that we assume the same to have happened
in reckoning the years of Nebuchadnezzar. In the West the latter had
been king <em>de facto</em> since he took command of the army in the last
months of 606/5, after his father had returned in Shebat (roughly
February) to Babylonia. During the whole of the following spring and
summer, until his father’s death, Nebuchadnezzar was in sole command
of the army in the field, as far as we know. Under such circumstances
it would scarcely be remarkable if his western subordinates began to
reckon his regnal years in 605/4 instead of a year later. The
chronology of Jeremiah would then be the normal Western calculation,
and not a specifically Jewish way of counting years. [2, p. 32]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However this does not seem to explain Jeremiah 32:1 “the tenth year of
Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar.”, since if Jeremiah is consistently using the “Western
calculation” then it should actually say the seventeenth year of
Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p>He also does not appear to explain the difference in the number of
exiles between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25.</p>
<h3 id="criticism-1"><a class="header" href="#criticism-1">Criticism</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>W. F. Albright, who holds that in the west Nebuchadnezzar’s official
accession year (605/604) was considered his first regnal year, and
that all data pertaining to Nebuchadnezzar given in Biblical records
(with the exception of a passage in Jer 52:28-30) were one year higher
than the Babylonian numbering, and thus differed by one year from the
official Babylonian reckoning. This theory can hardly be correct,
because it would seem strange indeed that the Jewish annalists should
have used for Nebuchadnezzar the antedating (or non-accession-year)
system, while they used the postdating (accession-year) system for
their own kings. That the Babylonians used the postdating system is
well known and needs no demonstration, and all scholars agree that
this system was also used by the Jewish writers with regard to the
regnal years of their own kings. Should it therefore not be more
plausible to assume that the Jewish historians used the postdating
system consistently in their records for the kings of Babylonia as
well as for their own kings? [3, p. 23]</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-megiddo-6"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-megiddo-6">Battle of Megiddo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the month Du’uzu of the seventeenth year of Nabopolassar, which
corresponds to June 25—July 23 of 609 B. C., the city of Harran was
attacked by Ashur-uballit, king of Assyria, and “a large Egyptian
army.” This city had been conquered by the Babylonians in the previous
year, when the Egyptians may have been present in Syria. The course of
events is difficult to reconstruct because of the lacunae in the
cuneiform text, but it appears that the Assyro-Egyptian forces
directed their main assault upon the garrison which had been stationed
in Harran by the Babylonians, and that they were at first successful,
but could not decisively defeat the defenders. They thereupon laid
seige (sic) to the city for about two months, until the month Ululu
(Aug. 23—Sep. 20). When Nabopolassar approached with his army, the
attackers retired, apparently without meeting Nabopolassar in battle.
The Egyptians returned to their own land, and nothing more is heard of
Ashur-uballit. <br><br> The death of Josiah must be understood in
connection with these events. He had pursued a successful
anti-Assyrian policy for many years, and must have been aware that
Egypt was in alliance with the Assyrians. He could not afford to see
the Egyptians advance to the aid of Ashur-uballit, and so went out to
meet Pharaoh Neco on his way to Syria. The laconic account of the
biblical historian in 2 Kings xxiii 29 is simply, “and Pharaoh Neco
slew him at Megiddo when he saw him.” This encounter must have taken
place before the attack on Harran by the Assyro-Egyptian forces. Since
it was customary for Near Eastern kings to mount their campaigns in
the spring, and since Neco needed time to make his junction with the
Assyrian forces and prepare for the attack on Harran, we must place
the death of Josiah no later than May, 609, and possibly
earlier.<br><br> On the death of Josiah, his son Jehoahaz was placed
on the throne by “the people of the land,” and ruled for three months.
At the end of that time he was deposed by Neco, who replaced him with
his brother Jehoiakim. The three months of Jehoiakim’s (sic) reign
must coincide with the time consumed by Neco in his march from Megiddo
to Harran and a part of the attack on that city. 2 Kings xxiii 33-34
says that it was in Riblah in the land of Hamath that Neco put
Jehoahaz in bonds, and laid a large tribute on Judah. He then made
Jehoiakim king of Judah and took Jehoahaz with him, eventually to
Egypt. These events ought to be dated soon after the initial success
at Harran while the Pharaoh was still in Syria, not after the approach
of the Babylonian army of Nabopolassar.10 Such actions by the Egyptian
king would hardly have been possible at the latter time. Hence, we
should date the dethronement of Jehoahaz and the accession of
Jehoiakim in July or early August, 609. [3, p. 207]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-6"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-6">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The new documents confirm the fact that there was a battle of
Carchemish in 605 in which the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians.
This battle is mentioned in Jer 46:2 and by Josephus (<em>Ant. Jud.</em> X.
vi. 1; <em>Contra Apionem</em> I. 19), and the excavation of Carchemish
indicated that the city had been taken around 600. B. M. 21946, obv.
11. 1-8 gives a rather full account of the conflict. The date was
between April and August 605; Wiseman suggests probably May-June.
Nebuchadrezzar, the crown prince and eldest son of Nabopolassar, was
in command of the Babylonian army; his father evidently had remained
at home because of illness, for he died on 8 Ab (August 16, 605). The
record claims a complete defeat of the Egyptian army “into
nothingness” (<em>adi la bašē</em>). It also claims that at that time
Nebuchadrezzar conquered the whole of Hatti (<em>ana pāṭ gimrišu ikšud</em>).
Though it is clear that the battle of Carchemish was somewhat
decisive, the Egyptians still had considerable strength, and
Nebuchadrezzar had to make repeated invasions of Hatti (a general term
for Syria-Palestine) in order to maintain his control there. <br><br>
Nebuchadrezzar’s father died soon after the battle of Carchemish, and
the crown prince rushed to Babylon to take over the throne on 1 Elul
(September 7, 605). However, he was soon back in Hatti; the new
account says that he marched unopposed in Hatti until Shebat (February
604). Then he “took the heavy tribute of Hatti to Babylon” (Obv. 1.
13). Two months later he was in Babylon to observe the <em>akitu</em>
festival and take the hands of Bel and the son of Bel, apparently
signalizing his enthronement. [2, p. 279]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah-4"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah-4">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was probably in 605, or in the following year, that Jehoiakim
submitted to the Babylonian king, as recorded in II Kings 24:1; II
Chron 36:6 is probably a reminiscence of the submission, with some
exaggeration. Josephus indicates that after the battle of Carchemish
Nebuchadrezzar took all of Syria, as far as Pelusium, except Judah
(<em>Ant. Jud.</em> X. vi. 1); and II Kings 24:7 says that “the king of
Babylon took all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of
Egypt to the River Euphrates.”<br><br> Nebuchadrezzar probably did
receive the submission of some of the western states at this time, but
the new texts indicate that he had to make campaigns into Hatti in
nearly every subsequent year in order to enforce the payment of
tribute and keep control. In his first year he marched to Hatti in
Sivan (June 604). We are told that “all the kings of Hatti came before
him, and he received their heavy tribute” (Obv. 1. 17). The next line
tells of his capturing and destroying a city; Wiseman reads it as
Ashkelon (<em><sup>al</sup>iš-qi-il-lu-nu</em>), but indicates that the first
two signs are uncertain, being written over an erasure. It is by no
means improbable that the Babylonian king had to fight against that
city (see below).<br><br> In his 3rd and 4th years Nebuchadrezzar was
back in Hatti. In the latter year he came into direct conflict with
the Egyptian army. After telling of his marching unopposed in Hatti,
the chronicle goes on to say: “In the month Kislev [beginning
November 20, 601] he took the lead of his army and marched to Egypt.
The king of Egypt heard, and mustered his army. In open battle they
smote the breast of each other and inflicted great destruction upon
each other. The king of Akkad and his army turned around, and went
back to Babylon” (Rev. 11. 6-7). The laconic account of the next year
is that the king of Akkad remained at home “and gathered together his
chariots and horses in great numbers” (Rev. 1. 8). The outcome of this
battle must have been defeat for the Babylonian army, or at best a
draw. This battle must lie back of Jehoiakim’s change of allegiance,
when he withheld tribute from Babylonia, probably making an alliance
with Egypt. II Kings 24:1 says that this occurred three years after
Jehoiakim became the servant of Nebuchadrezzar; three full years after
the submission of Jehoiakim in either 605 or 604 would bring us to
this date. It is impossible to tell whether Jehoiakim’s change of
allegiance brought on the invasion by Nebuchadrezzar, or whether
Jehoiakim rebelled after he saw the success of Egypt. The latter seems
more logical. The Kings account goes on to say that Yahweh sent
against Jehoiakim “bands” (גדודי) of Chaldeans, Syrians (or
Edomites?), Moabites, and Ammonites (24:2). This apparently means that
Nebuchadrezzar attempted to punish Jehoiakim by means of marauding
bands of his own men and some drawn from the western states under his
control. The destruction could not have been thorough; Jer
9:10-11,17-22, 12:7-13 may reflect some devastation in Judah at this
time. In his 6th year (599/8), after replenishing his army,
Nebuchadrezzar marched again to Hatti. This time he scoured the desert
to the east of Syria-Palestine and “took much plunder from the Arabs,
their possessions, animals, and gods” (Rev. 1. 10). He returned to his
own land in Adar (February-March 598), and it was at the end of the
same year (December) that he started the invasion that led to the
capture of Jerusalem. [2, p. 280]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hyatt doesn’t appear to directly explain how he believes this fits in
with Daniel 1:1, but he is placing the subjugation of Judah in the 4th
or 5th years of Jehoiakim, rather than the 3rd as specified in Daniel.</p>
<h3 id="captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-6"><a class="header" href="#captures-of-jehoiachin-and-zedekiah-6">Captures of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The date, 2 Adar of Nebuchadrezzar’s 7th year (March 16, 597) is not
contrary to the biblical accounts. II Kings 24:12 gives the date as
the 8th year of Nebuchadrezzar, whereas Jer 52:28 has the 7th year. It
is obvious that Kings uses a system which reckons the accession year
as the first year of a king’s reign, whereas Jer 52 employs the
Babylonian system which does not count the accession year, but reckons
as the first year of a king the year beginning with his formal
coronation in Nisan following his accession…<br><br> The new document
does not name any of the Judean kings, but it is obvious that the
captured king was Jehoiachin, and the king whom Nebuchadrezzar placed
on the throne was Zedekiah. According to the clear statement of the
text, Nebuchadrezzar mustered his army in Kislev (which began December
17, 598), and took Jerusalem on March 16, only three months later. If
we allow approximately a month for the march to Jerusalem and the
beginning of the siege, the siege itself could not have lasted much
more than two months, possibly less. According to II Kings 24:8
Jehoiachin had a reign of three months, while II Chron 36:9 gives him
three months and ten days. From these data, it would appear that
Jehoiakim died before the beginning of the siege. [2, p. 278]</p>

number of exiles between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Babylonian Chronicles allow the date of his death to be calculated
as the fourth month of 609 bc, which was in the year 610t. This was
thirtyone years after the beginning of Josiah’s reign in 641t, so the
reign length as given in 2 Kgs 22:1 is by accession reckoning,
showing, incidentally, that somewhere between 2 Kgs 22:1 and 24:1 the
counting system changed from accession to non-accession. [2, p. 35]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-7"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-7">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In Jer 46:2, the Battle of Carchemish is dated in the fourth year of
Jehoiakim, 609t – 3 (acc) = 606t. The battle occurred in 605n/605t,
which is in the latter half of the year given by Jeremiah. [2, p.
36]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah-5"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah-5">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<p>Young does not appear to offer any explanation for when the subjugation
of Judah took place (2 Kings 24:1, Daniel 1:1).</p>
<h3 id="sieges-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#sieges-of-jerusalem">Sieges of Jerusalem</a></h3>
<p>Young’s chronology would have Jehoiakim in his 12th year at the time of
his death, he does not explain how this fits in with 2 Kings 23:36.</p>
<p>Young reads the deportations in Jeremiah 52:28-30 as corresponding to
the same years as the captives were taken in 2 Kings, however he does
not appear to justify the difference in numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writings of Jeremiah end with chapter 51 (Jer 51:64), so his
methods of dating are not automatically applicable to the contents of
chapter 52. The contents of that chapter, except for verses 28 through
30, are all parallel to passages in the last two chapters of 2 Kings,
so the methods already determined for these chapters in 2 Kings
(Tishri, non-accession reckoning) can be applied to the corresponding
verses in Jeremiah 52. Verses 28 through 30 are independent of the
Book of Kings and are interesting enough to require special
consideration. <br><br> Jer 52:28–30 gives the number of captives
taken by Nebuchadnezzar in his seventh, eighteenth, and twenty-third
years. There is one thing certain about the counting of captives—the
captives themselves are in no position to do it. Every king and
pharaoh must have had an official assigned to this task, so that the
number of those vanquished could be recorded on a stela or in the
annals glorifying the king’s exploits. Thus the list of captives in
Jer 52:28–30 could not have originated in a Judean record—it came from
the official records of Nebuchadnezzar. The years of the monarch would
therefore be the Nisan, accession years used in Babylon. This is an
independent verification of the use of non-accession years when
Jeremiah and the author of the last two chapters of 2 Kings referred
to Nebuchadnezzar: the seventh (accession) year of Jer 52:28
corresponds to the eighth (non-accession) year of 2 Kgs 24:12, and the
eighteenth (accession) year of Jer 52:29 corresponds to the nineteenth
(non-accession) year of 2 Kgs 25:8. These are not mistakes, as some
have assumed. They are a valuable clue that the synchronisms to
Nebuchadnezzar in 2 Kings were to be taken in a non-accession sense,
and this conclusion could have been reached from these texts alone
without going through the more thorough analysis of the present
article. [2, p. 36]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="release-of-jehoiachin-3"><a class="header" href="#release-of-jehoiachin-3">Release of Jehoiachin</a></h3>
<p>Young counts the 37 years of Jehoiachin on a Tishri-to-Tishri calendar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final synchronism in these chapters is 2 Kgs 25:27, which says
that Jehoiachin, in the thirty-seventh year of his captivity, was
released from prison by Evil-Merodach in the twelfth month of the year
that he became king. The Babylonian Tablets establish this date as
April 2, 561, shortly before Evil-Merodach’s first full year that
began in Nisan of 561. The thirty-seventh year of Jehoiachin’s exile
was 598t – 36 (acc) = 562t, which is consistent with the date given in
the Babylonian Tablets. [2, p. 32]</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> As explained in the <a href="judean/solutions/../../watchtower/README.html">Watchtower
Chronology</a> chapter the Watchtower uses a
different method for determining the destruction of Jerusalem and reign
of Nebuchadnezzar, the first year listed is that used by the Watchtower,
and the second would be the equivalent under the orthodox Babylonian
chronology allowing easy comparison to the other chronologies in the
section.</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-megiddo-8"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-megiddo-8">Battle of Megiddo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward the close of Josiah’s 31-year reign (659-629 B.C.E.), Pharaoh
Necho led his army northward to the aid of the Assyrians. For a reason
not revealed in the Bible, King Josiah disregarded “the words of Necho
from the mouth of God” and tried to turn the Egyptian forces back at
Megiddo, but he was mortally wounded in the attempt. He was brought
back to Jerusalem in a war chariot and died either en route or upon
arrival there. [1, pp. 118, JOSIAH]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After the death of good King Josiah in 628 B.C.E., his three sons and
a grandson proved to be bad in their dealings. [2, p. 25]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jehoahaz was 23 years old when made king, and he ruled badly for three
months in the early part of the year 628 B.C.E., until he was
imprisoned at Riblah by Pharaoh. Later he was taken to Egypt, where he
died in captivity, just as the prophet Jeremiah had foretold.—2Ki
23:31-34; Jer 22:10-12. [3, pp. 1265, JEHOAHAZ]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Three months later (in 628 B.C.E.) Nechoh removed Josiah’s son and
successor Jehoahaz from the Judean throne and replaced him with his
brother Eliakim (renamed Jehoiakim), carrying Jehoahaz captive to
Egypt. (2Ki 23:31-35; 2Ch 36:1-4; compare Eze 19:1-4.) [3, pp. 698,
EGYPT, EGYPTIAN]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There appears to be a problem here - according to <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">BM
21901</a> Line 66 the Egyptian army
crossed the Euphrates to help the king of Assyria in Tammuz (the 4th
month). Therefore Josiah must have died prior to this when he
intercepted Necho at Megiddo - about 500 km before the river, likely
around the 3rd month (May 629/609) [4, p. 228] [5, p. 139] [6, p.
31] [7, p. 29] [8, p. 17] [9, p. 208].</p>
<p>However the Watchtower chronology requires that Josiah died at the start
of 628/608, such that following Jehoahaz’s rule of 3 months the 1st year
of Jehoiakim would begin shortly after Nisan 1 (March/April) 628. The
actual death of Josiah in May 629/609 as indicated by the chronicle
would require either moving Jehoiakim’s reign a year earlier - which
would cause serious issues (Jeremiah 25:1, 46:2, 2 Kings 23:36), or that
there was an unexplained interregnum of at least 6 months between Josiah
and Jehoahaz.</p>
<p>In contradiction with their own chronology, the Watchtower has
acknowledged and agreed with the interpretation of the chronicle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chronicle states, under the 17th year of Nabopolassar (629
B.C.E.): “In the month Duʼuzu, Ashur-uballit, king of Assyria, (and) a
large [army of] E[gy]pt [who had come to his aid] crossed the
river (Euphrates) and [marched on] to conquer Harran.” (Ancient Near
Eastern Texts, p.305; brackets and parentheses theirs.) Actually,
Ashur-uballit was trying to reconquer it after having been driven out.
This record is in harmony with the account relative to the activity of
Pharaoh Nechoh recorded at 2 Kings 23:29, which activity resulted in
the death of King Josiah of Judah (c. 629 B.C.E.). This text states
that “Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt came up to the king of Assyria
by the river Euphrates”—evidently to help him. “The king of Assyria”
to whom Nechoh came may well have been Ashur-uballit II. Their
campaign against Haran did not succeed. The Assyrian Empire had ended.
[3, pp. 205, ASSYRIA]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I raised this issue in a <a href="judean/solutions/../../appendix/letter_josiah.html">letter to the
Watchtower</a>, however they declined to
answer my question.</p>
<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish-8"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-8">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (625 B.C.E.) saw
Nebuchadnezzar defeat Pharaoh Necho in a battle over the domination of
Syria- Palestine. The battle took place at Carchemish by the
Euphrates, over 600 km (370 mi) N of Jerusalem. (Jer 46:1, 2) [3, pp.
1268, JEHOIAKIM]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 625 B.C.E. a decisive battle was fought at Carchemish between the
Egyptian and Babylonian armies. Nebuchadnezzar led the Babylonians to
a smashing victory over Pharaoh Necho’s forces and swept over Syria
and Canaan. This battle marked the end of Egyptian imperial strength
in these regions. The Bible account at Jeremiah 46:2 is paralleled by
that of the Babylonian Chronicles (B.M. 21946), both describing the
defeat of the Egyptian army. [3, pp. 418, CARCHEMISH]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 21st year of Nabopolassar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar marched
with the Babylonian army to Carchemish, there to fight against the
Egyptians. He led his forces to victory. This took place in the fourth
year of Judean King Jehoiakim (625 B.C.E.).—Jer 46:2. [1, pp. 480,
NEBUCHADNEZZAR]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="capture-of-jehoiachin"><a class="header" href="#capture-of-jehoiachin">Capture of Jehoiachin</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, the rebellion of Judean King Jehoiakim against Nebuchadnezzar
evidently resulted in a siege being laid against Jerusalem by the
Babylonians. It appears that during this siege Jehoiakim died and his
son Jehoiachin ascended the throne of Judah. But a mere three months
and ten days thereafter the reign of the new king ended when
Jehoiachin surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar (in the month of Adar
[February-March] during Nebuchadnezzar’s seventh regnal year
[ending in Nisan 617 B.C.E.], according to the Babylonian
Chronicles). [1, pp. 480, NEBUCHADNEZZAR]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bible record is quite detailed in its account of the first
punitive expedition against the kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar (or
Nebuchadrezzar) in his seventh regnal year (or eighth year from his
accession to the throne). (Jer. 52:28; 2 Ki. 24:12) [10, p. 88]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the difference in the numbers of captives between 2 Kings and
Jeremiah 52:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it was more than a decade later, in 617 B.C.E., that the first
captives from Jerusalem were taken into exile at Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar came against the rebellious city and carried off the
upper class of the population, including King Jehoiachin and his
mother, and men such as Ezekiel, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah, together with “the princes and all the valiant, mighty
men—ten thousand he was taking into exile—and also every craftsman and
builder of bulwarks. No one had been left behind except the lowly
class of the people . . . Court officials and the foremost men of the
land he led away as exiled people from Jerusalem to Babylon. As for
all the valiant men, seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the
builders of bulwarks, a thousand, all the mighty men carrying on war,
the king of Babylon proceeded to bring them as exiled people to
Babylon.” He also took much of the treasure from the temple. (2Ki
24:12-16; Es 2:6; Eze 1:1-3; Da 1:2, 6) Jehoiachin’s uncle Zedekiah
was left behind as a vassal king. A few others of note, including the
prophet Jeremiah, also remained in Jerusalem. In view of the large
number of captives recorded at 2 Kings 24:14, the figure 3,023 given
at Jeremiah 52:28 apparently refers to those of a certain rank, or to
those who were family heads—their wives and children, numbering
thousands, not being included in the figure. [3, pp. 415, CAPTIVITY]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against the idea that Jeremiah 52:28 only refers to the adult males
Green says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bright’s theory that the 3,023 in Jeremiah refer only to adult males
does not narrow the gap because all the classification listed in Kings
are certainly men. [11, p. 64]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="capture-of-zedekiah"><a class="header" href="#capture-of-zedekiah">Capture of Zedekiah</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometime later Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, allying
himself with Egypt for military protection. (Eze 17:15; compare Jer
27:11-14.) This brought the Babylonians back to Jerusalem, and on
Tebeth (December-January) 10 in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign,
Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem. (2Ki 24:20; 25:1; 2Ch 36: 13)
However, news that a military force of Pharaoh was coming out of Egypt
caused the Babylonians to lift the siege temporarily. (Jer 37:5)
Subsequently Pharaoh’s troops were forced to go back to Egypt, and the
Babylonians resumed the siege against Jerusalem. (Jer 37:7-10)
Finally, in 607 B.C.E., on Tammuz (June-July) 9 in the 11th year of
Zedekiah’s reign (Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year if counting from his
accession year or his 18th regnal year), a breach was made in
Jerusalem’s wall. [1, pp. 481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again on the number of exiles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zedekiah’s sons, the princes of Judah, court officials, certain
priests, and many other prominent citizens were put to death at the
order of the king of Babylon. (2Ki 25:7, 18-21; Jer 52:10, 24-27) All
of this could account for the rather low number of those actually
listed as exiles that were led off, the number given being only 832,
probably heads of households, their wives and children not being
counted. —Jer 52:29. [3, pp. 416, CAPTIVITY]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="release-of-jehoiachin-4"><a class="header" href="#release-of-jehoiachin-4">Release of Jehoiachin</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Second ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire; son of Nabopolassar and
father of Awil-Marduk (Evil-merodach), who succeeded him to the
throne. Nebuchadnezzar ruled as king for 43 years (624-582 B.C.E.)
[1, pp. 480, NEBUCHADNEZZAR]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>In the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile, Ezekiel began his prophetic
work. (Eze 1:2) About 32 years later, evidently in 580 B.C.E.,
Jehoiachin was released from prison by Nebuchadnezzar’s successor
Evil-merodach (Awil-Marduk) and given a position of favor above all
the other captive kings. Thereafter he ate at Evil-merodach’s table
and received a daily allowance.—2Ki 25:27-30; Jer 52:31-34. [3, pp.
1267, JEHOIACHIN]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Insight book appears to imply there was a gap of up to one year
between the death of Nebuchadnezzar in his 43rd year (the year spanning
582-581), and the accession of Evil-Merodach (Amel-Marduk) in the year
spanning (581-580). This would be consistent with the arguments made in
the Watchtower 2011:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the documents show that Nebuchadnezzar II was still
ruling in his tenth month—six months after his successor is assumed to
have begun reigning. <br><br> Could others have ruled between the
reigns of these kings? If so, additional years would have to be added
to the Neo-Babylonian period. [12]</p>

<p>As listed in the <a href="judean/solutions/watchtower.html">Watchtower Judean Chronology</a>
table the Watchtower dates the Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion of Judah as
described in 2 Kings 24:1 to sometime in the 8th year of Jehoiakim.</p>
<p>Unusually however the Watchtower then chooses to interpret the siege of
Jerusalem described in Daniel 1:1 and 2 Chronicles 36:6 as referring to
the later siege resulting in Jehoiachin’s capture (2 Kings 24:10, which
was the 11th year of Jehoiakim), rather than the earlier invasion
resulting in Jehoiakim becoming a vassal for 3 years (2 Kings 24:1).</p>
<h3 id="insight-book"><a class="header" href="#insight-book">Insight Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Second Kings 24:1 shows that Nebuchadnezzar brought pressure upon the
Judean king “and so Jehoiakim became his servant [or vassal] for
three years. However, he [Jehoiakim] turned back and rebelled
against him [Nebuchadnezzar].” Evidently it is to this third year of
Jehoiakim as a vassal king under Babylon that Daniel refers at Daniel
1:1. It could not be Jehoiakim’s third year of his 11-year reign over
Judah, for at that time Jehoiakim was a vassal, not to Babylon, but to
Egypt’s Pharaoh Necho. It was not until Jehoiakim’s fourth year of
rule over Judah that Nebuchadnezzar demolished Egyptian domination
over Syria-Palestine by his victory at Carchemish (625 B.C.E.
[apparently after Nisan]). (Jer 46:2) Since Jehoiakim’s revolt
against Babylon led to his downfall after about 11 years on the
throne, the beginning of his three-year vassalage to Babylon must have
begun toward the end of his eighth year of rule, or early in 620
B.C.E.<br><br> Daniel’s account (1:1, 2) states that Nebuchadnezzar
came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and that Jehoiakim, along
with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s
hand. However, the account at 2 Kings 24:10-15 describes the siege of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son
Jehoiachin, whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the
one who finally capitulated and went out to the Babylonians. It
therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city,
perhaps in the early part thereof. Jehovah’s prophecy through Jeremiah
(22:18, 19; 36:30) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a
decent burial; his corpse was to lie unattended outside the gates of
Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by night.
Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’
(Da 1:2) is not revealed. It may have been in the sense of his dying
under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into
captivity, so that Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship
at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish
tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim
and commanded that his dead body be thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls.
(Jewish Antiquities, X, 97 [vi, 3]) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s
death came, it appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had
brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.—2Ch 36:6.
[1, pp. 1269, JEHOIAKIM]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Very little is known of his early life, but he [Daniel] tells of
being taken to Babylon, likely as a teenage prince, along with other
royal offspring and nobles. (Da 1:3-6) This was in Jehoiakim’s third
year (as tributary king to Babylon), which third year started in the
spring of 618 B.C.E. (Da 1:1) With Jehoiakim’s inglorious death,
Jehoiachin, his son, ruled for a few months before surrendering. Early
in 617 B.C.E., Jehoiachin and other “foremost men,” also young Daniel
(2Ki 24:15), were taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. [1, pp.
576, DANIEL]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the age of 18 Jehoiachin became king and continued the bad
practices of his father. (2Ki 24:8, 9; 2Ch 36:9, ftn) Jehoiachin’s
father, Jehoiakim, had been under subjection to Babylonian King
Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled in his third year of such vassalage (618
B.C.E.). (2Ki 24:1) This resulted in a siege being laid against
Jerusalem. The expression “during that time” (2Ki 24:10) may refer,
not to Jehoiachin’s brief reign, but to the general period in which it
fits, hence allowing for the siege to have begun during his father
Jehoiakim’s reign, as Daniel 1:1, 2 seems to indicate. It appears that
Jehoiakim died during this siege and Jehoiachin ascended the throne of
Judah. His rule ended, however, a mere three months and ten days
later, when he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E. (in the
month of Adar, according to a Babylonian chronicle). (2Ki 24:11, 12;
2Ch 36:9; Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, by A. Grayson, 1975,
p. 102) In fulfillment of Jehovah’s word through Jeremiah, he was
taken into Babylonian exile. (Jer 22:24-27; 24:1; 27:19, 20; 29:1, 2)
Other members of the royal household, court officials, craftsmen, and
warriors were also exiled.—2Ki 24:14-16; [1, pp. 1267, JEHOIACHIN]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="daniel-book"><a class="header" href="#daniel-book">Daniel Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel 1:1 reads: “In the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the
king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
and proceeded to lay siege to it.” Critics have found fault with this
scripture because it does not seem to agree with Jeremiah, who says
that the fourth year of Jehoiakim was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar. (Jeremiah 25:1; 46:2) Was Daniel contradicting
Jeremiah? With more information, the matter is readily clarified. When
first made king in 628 B.C.E. by Pharaoh Necho, Jehoiakim became a
mere puppet of that Egyptian ruler. This was about three years before
Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father to the throne of Babylon, in 624
B.C.E. Soon thereafter (in 620 B.C.E.), Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah
and made Jehoiakim a vassal king under Babylon. (2 Kings 23:34; 24:1)
To a Jew living in Babylon, Jehoiakim’s “third year” would have been
the third year of that king’s vassal service to Babylon. Daniel wrote
from that perspective. Jeremiah, however, wrote from the perspective
of the Jews living right in Jerusalem. So he referred to Jehoiakim’s
kingship as starting when Pharaoh Necho made him king. [2, p. 18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 625 B.C.E., Egyptian Pharaoh Necho… led his army to Carchemish… The
Babylonian army, led by Crown Prince Nebuchadnezzar, inflicted a
devastating blow on Pharaoh Necho’s forces. (Jeremiah 46:2) Riding on
the momentum of his victory, Nebuchadnezzar swept over Syria and
Palestine and, for all practical purposes, put an end to Egyptian
domination in this region. It was only the death of his father,
Nabopolassar, that brought a temporary halt to his campaign.<br><br>
The next year, Nebuchadnezzar—now enthroned as king of Babylon—once
again turned his attention to his military campaigns in Syria and
Palestine. It was during this period that he came to Jerusalem for the
first time. The Bible reports: “In his days Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon came up, and so Jehoiakim became his servant for three years.
However, he turned back and rebelled against him.”—2 Kings 24:1. [2,
p. 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="let-your-kingdom-come"><a class="header" href="#let-your-kingdom-come">Let Your Kingdom Come</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Later writers quote Berossus as saying that after the battle of
Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar extended Babylonian influence into all
Syria-Palestine and, when returning to Babylon (in his accession year,
605 B.C.E.), he took Jewish captives into exile. Thus they figure the
70 years as a period of servitude to Babylon beginning in 605 B.C.E.
That would mean that the 70-year period would expire in 535
B.C.E.<br><br> But there are a number of major problems with this
interpretation:<br><br> Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar
took Jewish captives in his accession year, there are no cuneiform
documents supporting this. More significantly, Jeremiah 52:28-30
carefully reports that Nebuchadnezzar took Jews captive in his seventh
year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his accession year. Also,
Jewish historian Josephus states that in the year of the battle of
Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar conquered all of Syria-Palestine “excepting
Judea,” thus contradicting Berossus and conflicting with the claim
that 70 years of Jewish servitude began in Nebuchadnezzar’s accession
year.—Antiquities of the Jews X, vi, 1. [3, p. 188]</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-interpretation"><a class="header" href="#history-of-the-interpretation">History of the Interpretation</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind interpreting Daniel 1:1 Jehoiakim as actually referring
to the siege described in 2 Kings 24:10 may have originated with
first-century historian Josephus, who dates the beginning of Jehoiakim’s
servitude to his 8th year:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>NOW in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, one whose name
was Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians, who at
the same time went up with a great army to the city Carchemish, which
was at Euphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco
king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. And when Neco understood
the intention of the king of Babylon, and that this expedition was
made against him, he did not despise his attempt, but made haste with
a great band of men to Euphrates to defend himself from
Nebuchadnezzar; and when they had joined battle, he was beaten, and
lost many ten thousands [of his soldiers] in the battle. So the king
of Babylon passed over Euphrates, and took all Syria, as far as
Pelusium, excepting Judea. But when Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned
four years, which was the eighth of Jehoiakim’s government over the
Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces
against the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim, and threatened
upon his refusal to make war against him. He was aftrighted at his
threatening, and bought his peace with money, and brought the tribute
he was ordered to bring for three years. <br><br> 2. But on the third
year, upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians made an expedition
against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute; yet was he
disappointed of his hope, for the Egyptians durst not fight at this
time… <br><br> 3. Now, a little time afterwards, the king of Babylon
made an expedition against Jehoiakim, whom he received [into the
city], and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of this
prophet, as supposing he should suffer nothing that was terrible,
because he neither shut the gates, nor fought against him; yet when he
was come into the city, he did not observe the covenants he had made,
but he slew such as were in the flower of their age, and such as were
of the greatest dignity, together with their king Jehoiakim, whom he
commanded to be thrown before the walls, without any burial; and made
his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the city: he also took
the principal persons in dignity for captives, three thousand in
number, and led them away to Babylon; among which was the prophet
Ezekiel, who was then but young. And this was the end of king
Jehoiakim, when he had lived thirty-six years, and of them reigned
eleven. But Jehoiachin succeeded him in the kingdom, whose mother’s
name was Nehushta; she was a citizen of Jerusalem. He reigned three
months and ten days. 1. BUT a terror seized on the king of Babylon,
who had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin, and that immediately; he was
afraid that he should bear him a grudge, because of his killing his
father, and thereupon should make the country revolt from him;
wherefore he sent an army, and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem; but
because he was of a gentle and just disposition, he did not desire to
see the city endangered on his account, but he took his mother and
kindred, and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of
Babylon… [4, pp. Ant X 6–7]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The earliest reference I could find in the Watchtower index for Daniel
1:1 was the 1946 <em>Equipped for Every Good Work</em>; published a decade
before the translation of the Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle <a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Daniel 1:1, 2 fixes the start of this first captivity in the
“third year” of Jehoiakim, who started to reign in Judah in 628 B.C.
Would not this mean the captivity of Daniel and others started in 626
B.C., Jehoiakim’s third year as king of Judah? No, this could not be,
because Nebuchadnezzar was not enthroned till the following year, 625
B.C. Actually, the opening verse of Daniel means that in “the third
year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah” <em>as a tributary king of
Babylon</em> “came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and
besieged it”. How so? Because Jehoiakim was put on the throne by
Egyptian decree and was tributary to Egypt for several years, but when
Babylon defeated Egypt Jehoiakim came under Babylonian control and so
remained for three years, after which three year period as tributary
to Babylon the Judean king rebelled. (2 Ki. 24:1) That third year as
tributary king to Nebuchadnezzar was the eleventh and last of his
total kingship, because the Babylonian monarch came against the
rebellious Jewish king and quickly completed the conquest during the
three-month reign of Jehoiakim’s successor Jehoiachin. Hence 618 B.C.
was the time of the first captivity and the starting point of history
in the book of Daniel. [5, p. 225]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then regarding Daniel 2:1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time of this dream and its interpretation is stated as the second
year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. Actually, Nebuchadnezzar had been
reigning over Babylon alone much longer than two years. Why, at the
time of this dream the young captive Daniel had completed his three
years of special court training and had been introduced to
Nebuchadnezzar and had gained quite a reputation for wisdom,
particularly in dreams and visions. In the nineteenth year of his
reign Nebuchadnezzar was used as God’s executioner to destroy
faithless Jerusalem and end Israel’s history as an independent
Theocratic nation. Then Nebuchadnezzar began reigning in a unique way,
as the first of the world rulers of the Gentile times. In the second
year of his reign in this special capacity the dream showing the end
of Satan’s organization and rule and the taking over of power by
Christ’s kingdom came to Nebuchadnezzar, as recorded at chapter 2 .
Here again, as at Daniel 1:1, the peculiarity which the writer of this
book has of making a secondary reckoning of the years of a king’s
reign is demonstrated. He reckons by counting from epochal events
within the reign that put the king in a new relationship. [5, p.
226]</p>

<h2 id="criticism-2"><a class="header" href="#criticism-2">Criticism</a></h2>
<h3 id="kingship-daniel-11-and-daniel-21"><a class="header" href="#kingship-daniel-11-and-daniel-21">“Kingship”, Daniel 1:1 and Daniel 2:1</a></h3>
<p>First of all the Watchtower Society is reading Daniel 1:1 in a strange
way - where “kingship” is understood to refer not to the length of
Jehoiakim’s rule over Judah, but to his time as a vassal to
Nebuchadnezzar. Against this interpretation Mercer argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several commentators take the third year of Jehoiakim as being the
last of the three years of servitude to Babylon mentioned in 2 Kgs
24:1. This solution is unlikely, for the text of Daniel states that
Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem “in the third year of the reign of
Jehoiakim” (bšnṯ šlwš lmlḵwṯ), not “in the third year of the servitude
of Jehoiakim” (bšnṯ šlwš lᶜḇwḏh)—as one might expect if the statement
in Dan 1:1 were derived from 2 Kgs 24:1. [6, p. 180]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This causes an even more substantial problem in that in Daniel 2:1,
Daniel speaks with Nebuchadnezzar during “the second year of his
kingship” - which would be impossible if Daniel was taken captive
sometime around the 7th or 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar. This forces the
Watchtower to use another different interpretation for the meaning of
“kingship” in Daniel 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book of Daniel states that it was in “the second year” of
Nebuchadnezzar’s kingship (probably counting from the destruction of
Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. and therefore actually referring to his 20th
regnal year) that Nebuchadnezzar had the dream about the golden-headed
image. [7, pp. 481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR] also [1, pp. 576, DANIEL] [1,
pp. 1186, IMAGE] [8, p. 18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He had effectively become world ruler in 607 B.C.E. when Jehovah God
allowed him to destroy Jerusalem and its temple. In the second year of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign as world ruler (606/605 B.C.E.), God sent him a
terrifying dream. [2, p. 46]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the translation of “kingship” / “reign” in Daniel Foley says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In understanding the first problem, it may be important that the
Hebrew word translated reign in Daniel 1:1 (NIV) is malchut which
appears to be a less specific term for the years of reign than regnal
years, since its use conveys the thought of “kingship” or “sovereign
power”… It is often used without a specific length of time, (e.g.,
Ezra 4:5– 6, Nehemiah 12:22, Jeremiah 49:34) or used in a different
way, as in 2 Chronicles 15:10, where the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign
(kingship) is probably dated from his birth rather than from his
accession year. Thus Daniel 1:1 could be translated “in the third year
of the kingship of Jehoiakim” and could reflect a less precise
reckoning that ignores the month to month differences and sees his
reign beginning in 608 BC and the current year being 605 BC, a
difference of three years. This approach may also help us to
understand the second problem, since it should be noted that the
Hebrew word for reign in Daniel 2:1 is also malchut , so 603 BC must
be the second year of Nebuchadnezzar. [9, p. 33]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Three major Hebrew words translate as “reign” in the NIV. The first of
these is yom, the word that means “days” or “years”; for example, 1
Chronicles 7:2 translated “during the reign of David” is more
literally translated “during the days (or years) of David.” The second
word, malak, occurs 350 times, and in the book of Kings is usually
translated “began to reign” and may be a word that specifically
targets the regnal years of a king. This word is used once in Daniel
in Daniel 9:2 with reference to the first year of the reign of Darius
the Mede. The third word, malchut , occurs ninety times and seems to
be a somewhat less specific word for “kingship” or alternatively for
periods of reign calculated using exclusive reckoning. In the book of
Daniel it is used in Daniel 1:1, 2:1, 5:26, 6:28 (twice), 8:1, and
8:23. [9, p. Appendix 6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However he still concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it would seem most likely that Daniel was taken from Jerusalem late in
605 BC for the purpose of being trained in Babylonian ways. He
completed this training very successfully, probably in 602 BC [9, p.
34]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="death-of-jehoiakim"><a class="header" href="#death-of-jehoiakim">Death of Jehoiakim</a></h3>
<p>As acknowledged in the Insight book [7, pp. 480, NEBUCHADNEZZAR], <a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> states that
<code>In the month Kislev [IX] the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu</code>,
and then that
<code>on the second day of the month Adar [XII] he captured the city (and) seized (its) king.</code></p>
<p>According to 2 Chronicles 36:9 and 2 Kings 24:8, Jehoiachin reigned in
Jerusalem for 3 months and 10 days, subtracting this from the end of his
rule on 2/XII, his rule must have began (and Jehoiakim must have died)
around the end of month VIII, which would be before Nebuchadnezzar
marched to Jerusalem. [10, p. 278]</p>
<p>How can Daniel 1:2 where “Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his
hand” (NWT) and 2 Chronicles 36:6 where “Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against him [Jehoiakim] in order to bind him with two copper
fetters to take him off to Babylon” (NWT) make sense in this context
given that Jehoiakim had already died before Nebuchadnezzar marched
against the city?</p>
<p>According to Clines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some kind of an attack upon Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim is
demanded by the evidence of 2 Chr. 36:6f., which recounts that
Nebuchadrezzar took Jehoiakim in fetters to BabyIon, and also carried
off some of the temple vessels. This cannot have happened at the time
of the siege of Jerusalem in early 597 B.C., since Jehoiakim died on
December 7, 598, just before the Babylonian troops set out for
Jerusalem. So if the Biblical Chronicles tradition is sound, it is
reasonable to suppose that at some time during his reign ‘Jehoiakim
took part of the temple treasure [to Babylon] as a <em>qatrē</em>-offering
or as <em>biltu</em> (’tribute’) to buy off the Babylonians’. 2 Kings 24:1,
‘Nebuchadnezzar came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three
years’, may in turn be related to the same circumstances. [11, p.
21]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast the siege in the first year of Jehoiachin in 2 Kings 24 is
described in an order consistent with the Babylonian account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6</strong> Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers…<br> <strong>8</strong>
Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned for
three months in Jerusalem… <strong>9</strong> He continued to do what was bad in
Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that his father had done. <strong>10</strong>
During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. (2 Kings
24:6,8-10, NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="marauder-bands"><a class="header" href="#marauder-bands">Marauder Bands</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong> In Jehoiakim’s days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against
him, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. However, he
turned against him and rebelled. <strong>2</strong> Then Jehovah began to send
against him marauder bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and
Ammonites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it…<br> <strong>6</strong>
Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son
Jehoiachin became king in his place. (2 Kings 24:1,2,6,10 NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Watchtower Society Jehoiakim began his three years
servitude in his 8th year “early in 620 B.C.E.” [1, pp. 1269,
JEHOIAKIM] and then rebelled at the end of the three years resulting in
the siege of Jerusalem in “618 B.C.E.” [1, pp. 1267, JEHOIACHIN]. The
Insight book also states that it “appears that Jehoiakim died during the
siege of the city” (or as shown above, he actually died just before it
began).</p>
<p>When therefore would the multiple attacks of marauder bands have occured
if Jehoiakim’s rebellion (at the end of three years servitude) is
immediately followed by his death and the accession of Jehoiachin?</p>

<p>Against this argument the Watchtower states in the Kingdom Come book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 52:28-30 carefully reports that Nebuchadnezzar took Jews
captive in his seventh year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his
accession year. [3, p. 188]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However it is already seen that Jeremiah does not contain a complete
count of the captives since it contradicts the number (and also year,
depending on interpretation) of captives described in 2 Kings 24:14
(3023 in the 7th year vs 10,000+ in the 8th year), so Jeremiah 52 surely
should not be treated as an exhaustive list of all captives taken by
Nebuchadnezzar. [1, pp. 415, CAPTIVITY]</p>
<h3 id="nebuchadnezzars-conquest-of-hattu"><a class="header" href="#nebuchadnezzars-conquest-of-hattu">Nebuchadnezzar’s Conquest of Hattu</a></h3>
<p>The Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle <a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> provides a detailed account of
Nebuchadnezzar’s activities during his early years as king:</p>
<p>Accession Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The twenty-first year]: The king of Akkad stayed home (while)
Nebuchadnezzar (II), his eldest son (and) the crown prince, mustered
[the army of Akkad]. He took his army’s lead and marched to
Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates. He crossed the river
[to encounter the army of Egypt] which was encamped at Carchemish.
[…] They did battle together. The army of Egypt retreated before
him. He inflicted a [defeat] upon them (and) finished them off
completely. In the district of Hamath the army of Akkad overtook the
remainder of the army of [Egypt which] managed to escape [from]
the defeat and which was not overcome. They (the army of Akkad)
inflicted a defeat upon them (so that) a single (Egyptian) man [did
not return] home. <strong>At that time Nebuchadnezzar (II) conquered all of
Ha[ma]th.</strong> For twenty-one years Nabopolassar ruled Babylon. <strong>In
(his) accession year Nebuchadnezzar (II) returned to Hattu. Until the
month Shebat he marched about victoriously in Hattu.</strong> In the month
Shebat <strong>he took the vast booty of Hattu</strong> to Babylon. In the month
Nisan he took the hand of Bel and the son of Bel (and) celebrated the
Akitu festival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first year of Nebuchadnezzar (II): In the month Sivan <strong>he
mustered his army and marched to Hattu. Until the month Kislev he
marched about victoriously in Hattu. All the kings of Hattu came into
his presence and he received their vast tribute.</strong> He marched to
Ashkelon and in the month Kislev he captured it, seized its king,
plundered [and sac]ked it. He turned the city into a ruin heap. In
the month Shebat he marched away and [returned] to Bab[ylon].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sec[ond year]: In the month Iyyar <strong>the king of Akkad
strengthened his large army and [marched to Hattu]</strong>. He encamped
[…] … large siege towers he moved acr[oss … … from the month]
Iyyar until the month <strong>[… he marched about victoriously in
Hattu]</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Third Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The third year: In the month …, on] the thirteenth [day]
Nabu-shumu-lishir […] [In the month … <strong>the king of Akka]d
mustered his army and [marched] to Hattu.</strong> [… …] He brought the
vast [booty] of Hattu into Akkad. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth year: <strong>The king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to
Hattu. [He marched about victoriously] in Hattu.</strong> In the month
Kislev he took his army’s lead and marched to Egypt. (When) the king
of Egypt heard (the news) he m[ustered] his army. They fought one
another in the battlefield and both sides suffered severe losses (lit.
they inflicted a major defeat upon one another). The king of Akkad and
his army turned and [went back] to Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fifth year: <strong>The king of Akkad stayed home</strong> (and) refitted his
numerous horses and chariotry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sixth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sixth year: In the month Kislev <strong>the king of Akkad mustered his
army and marched to Hattu.</strong> He despatched his army from Hattu and
they went off to the desert. They plundered extensively the
possessions, animals, and gods of the numerous Arabs. In the month
Adar the king went home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seventh Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seventh year: In the month Kislev <strong>the king of Akkad mustered his
army and marched to Hattu. He encamped against the city of Judah</strong> and
on the second day of the month Adar he captured the city (and) seized
(its) king. A king of his own choice he appointed in the city (and)
taking the <strong>vast tribute</strong> he brought it into Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably in the 7th year the chronicle describes the siege of Jerusalem
where Jehoiachin is captured, and identifies it as being in the area of
“Hattu”. However from the chronicle we can also see that Nebuchadnezzar
also marched through Hattu in his accession, 1st-4th, and 6th years, and
even more significantly in the 1st year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their
<strong>vast tribute</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It therefore seems very unlikely that Jehoiakim did not become a vassal
of Nebuchadnezzar until his 8th year as dated by the Watchtower, instead
is it was likely to be sometime as early as the autumn of
Nebuchadnezzar’s accession year (the 4th year of Jehoiakim).</p>
<p>Against this argument the Kingdom Come book says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar took Jewish captives in his
accession year, there are no cuneiform documents supporting this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the tributes described in the chronicles should be interpreted
as including captives, such as in 7th year where Nebuchadnezzar took
“vast tribute”, which we already know must have included captives (Jer
52:28, 2 Kings 24:14).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the ‘accession year’ Nebuchadrezzar went back again to the Hatti
land and until the month of Sebat marched unopposed through the Hatti
land; in the month of Sebat he took the heavy tribute of the Hatti
territory to Babylon.<br><br> It is certain that this ‘heavy tribute’
consisted not only of treasure but also of prisoners from the
conquered countries. To refrain from doing so would have been
altogether too alien from the customs of the kings of Babylon and
Assyria. [12]</p>

</ul>
<p>If we took the <a href="judean/./solutions/watchtower.html">Watchtower Judean chronology</a>
but instead dated the subjugation of Jehoiakim to the accession year of
Nebuchadnezzar, then this would fall in the forth year of Jehoiakim,
which would actually be the <strong>third</strong> year if we assumed Daniel were
converting Jehoiakim’s reign to the Babylonian accession year system -
successfully integrating Daniel 1:1.</p>
<h3 id="daniels-training"><a class="header" href="#daniels-training">Daniel’s Training</a></h3>
<p>Assuming that Daniel was taken at some point in Nebuchadnezzar’s
accession year then we can count inclusively 3 years of training (Daniel
1:5), but this would be a maximum of about 2 ½ years actual length:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>There is of course the question of whether this actually matters - do
the events in chapter 2 do have to follow the 3 years training or could
they have taken place concurrently?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it simply would not be possible that Daniel and his three friends
could be so highly elevated in the affairs of the government of
Babylonia in chapter 2 (Dan. 2:48, 49) and afterward still have to
appear before King Nebuchadnezzar to obtain his approval by proving
their abilities “to stand in the king’s palace” (Dan. 1:4, 18–20) as
though they were yet mere students. But such would be the case were
the happenings of chapter 2 imbedded somewhere within the three-year
time frame of chapter 1. [13, p. 189]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, it may be urged that the dates in Daniel are not
self-consistent, and that it is not worth attempting to justify the
date in Dan. 1:1. If Daniel was taken to Babylon c. June-July 605, and
immediately began his three-year education (1:5), he cannot have
completed his education before the end of the ‘2nd year of
Nebuchadnezzar’ (ended 9 April, 602) in which the king had his dream
(2:1) and Daniel, already graduated (1:18ff.), gave its
interpretation. This conclusion could be avoided only if it were
maintained that the ‘3 years’ of 1:15 (sic) are counted inclusively;
but against that must be set the evidence for a fixed period of 3 full
years’ education, at least in the Persian court. [11, p. 28]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some commentators hold that the three years of Dan 1:5 were not three
full years (e-g., Driver, p. 17; Young, pp. 55-56). They would say
that Daniel was trained during the latter part of Nebuchadnezzar’s
accession year, all of his first year, and part of his second year.
That then would harmonize Dan 1:5 and 2:1. The fact that the three
years were a specific period of time set up for education would
suggest, however, that the years were three whole years, not a part of
three. There is also some evidence that in the Persian period the
length of training was indeed three full years (Montgomery, p. 122).
[6, p. 187]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted, however, that Dan 2 does not necessarily follow
Dan 1 chronologically. In addition, the text of Dan 2 suggests that he
was not finished with his training. After all, Daniel was evidently
not among those who were unable to interpret the dream (vv. 2-1 1;
cf. v. 27), nor had he even been informed of the matter (v. 15). Thus
it is entirely possible that Dan 2 records an incident that took place
after the story in Dan 1:8-17, but before the end of the three-year
period. [6, p. 187]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="timing-of-jehoiakims-rebellion"><a class="header" href="#timing-of-jehoiakims-rebellion">Timing of Jehoiakim’s Rebellion</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The revolt in 601 might have been connected with the new ascendency of
Egypt, whose new strength is evident from the defeat inflicted by
Necho on the attacking armies of Babylon in that year. [14, p. 229]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In his 3rd and 4th years Nebuchadrezzar was back in Hatti. In the
latter year he came into direct conflict with the Egyptian army. After
telling of his marching unopposed in Hatti, the chronicle goes on to
say: “In the month Kislev [beginning November 20, 601] he took the
lead of his army and marched to Egypt. The king of Egypt heard, and
mustered his army. In open battle they smote the breast of each other
and inflicted great destruction upon each other. The king of Akkad and
his army turned around, and went back to Babylon” (Rev. 11. 6-7). The
laconic account of the next year is that the king of Akkad remained at
home “and gathered together his chariots and horses in great numbers”
(Rev. 1. 8). The outcome of this battle must have been defeat for the
Babylonian army, or at best a draw. This battle must lie back of
Jehoiakim’s change of allegiance, when he withheld tribute from
Babylonia, probably making an alliance with Egypt. II Kings 24:1 says
that this occurred three years after Jehoiakim became the servant of
Nebuchadrezzar; three full years after the submission of Jehoiakim in
either 605 or 604 would bring us to this date. It is impossible to
tell whether Jehoiakim’s change of allegiance brought on the invasion
by Nebuchadrezzar, or whether Jehoiakim rebelled after he saw the
success of Egypt. The latter seems more logical. [10, p. 280]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At an unspecified time in his fourth year (30 Mar. 601-18 Mar. 600),
Nebuchadnezzar returned to Palestine. It was during this campaign (in
late 601) that Babylon and Egypt fought to a standstill, and
Nebuchadnezzar withdrew to Babylon with no tribute. It was also during
this campaign that Jehoiakim of Judah, who had paid tribute for the
past three years, rebelled against the Babylonians. This understanding
fits 2 Kgs 24:1, which states: “In his [Jehoiakim’s] days
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehohiakim became his
servant for three years; but then he turned and rebelled against him.”
[6, p. 188]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The impetus behind Jehoiakim’s rebellion was probably his renewal of
ties with his original overlord, Necho of Egypt, who had made him king
(2 Kgs 23:34-35). Jehoiakim’s ability to extradite gives evidence that
he was at one time a vassal of Egypt (cf. Jer 26:22-23). Necho also
imposed a very modest amount of tribute. Jehoiakim was a part of the
pro-Egyptian party in Jerusalem and probably hoped that Necho would
help him against the Babylonians. This renewed alliance would explain
Nebuchadnezzar’s march to Egypt in 601. [6, p. 190]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would seem likely that Jehoiakim’s rebellion was connected with the
Egyptian war in Nebuchadnezzar’s 4th year, counting back 3 full years
during which Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar would mean that he
must have become vassal somewhere around the accession or 1st year of
Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>The aim of this chapter is to answer the question of why Jehovah’s
Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem actually took place in 607
BC?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jeremiahs-70-year-prophesy"><a class="header" href="#jeremiahs-70-year-prophesy">Jeremiah’s 70 Year Prophesy</a></h1>
<p>The key to the Watchtower’s “Bible chronology” is their interpretation
of the prophesy written in Jeremiah 25:11 [1, pp. 463, CHRONOLOGY],
describing a 70 year period where Judah will serve the king of Babylon
[2, p. 26]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years before the destruction, the Jewish prophet Jeremiah provided an
essential clue to the time frame given in the Bible. He warned “all
those living in Jerusalem,” saying: “This whole country will become a
desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon
seventy years.” (Jeremiah 25:1, 2, 11, New International Version) The
prophet later added: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘In accord with
the fulfilling of seventy years at Babylon I shall turn my attention
to you people, and I will establish toward you my good word in
bringing you back to this place.’” (Jeremiah 29:10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They believe that the 70 years began in the 7th month of Zedekiah’s 11th
year / Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th year, when the land of Judah became
unworked and deserted [2, p. 27]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the 70 years were to be a period when the land of Judah and
Jerusalem would enjoy “sabbath rests.” This meant that the land would
not be cultivated—there would be no sowing of seed or pruning of
vineyards. (Leviticus 25:1-5, NIV) Because of the disobedience of
God’s people, whose sins may have included a failure to observe all
the Sabbath years, the punishment was that their land would remain
unworked and deserted for 70 years.—Leviticus 26:27, 32-35, 42, 43.
<br>…<br> A Jewish revolt brought the Babylonians back to Jerusalem.
(2 Kings 24:20; 25:8-10) They razed the city, including its sacred
temple, and they took many of its inhabitants captive to Babylon.
Within two months, “all the people [who had been left behind in the
land] from the least to the greatest, together with the army
officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.” (2 Kings 25:25,
26, NIV) Only then, in the seventh Jewish month, Tishri
(September/October), of that year could it be said that the land, now
desolate and unworked, began to enjoy its Sabbath rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They believe that the 70 years ended when the Jews had returned to
Jerusalem, which they date to the 2nd year of Cyrus in 537 BC (following
the proclamation in the first year) [2, p. 28]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ezra reflected on the prophecies of Jeremiah and linked the end of
“the seventy years” to the time when “the LORD moved the heart of
Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation.” (2 Chronicles 36:21, 22,
NIV) When were the Jews released? The decree ending their exile was
issued in “the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia.” Thus, by the
fall of 537 B.C.E., the Jews had returned to Jerusalem to restore true
worship.—Ezra 1:1-5; 2:1; 3:1-5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally by counting back 70 years they arrive at 607 BC for the
destruction of Jerusalem [2, p. 28]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Bible chronology, then, the 70 years was a literal period
of time that ended in 537 B.C.E. Counting back 70 years, the start
date of the period would be 607 B.C.E.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reign-of-cyrus"><a class="header" href="#reign-of-cyrus">Reign of Cyrus</a></h1>
<p>In order to determine when the 70 years of Jeremiah (25:11) ended and
the Jews returned to Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 36:23, Ezra 1:1) the
Watchtower needs to date the reign of Cyrus, and his conquest of
Babylon. They have therefore offered a couple of different sources:</p>
<h2 id="olympiad-numbers"><a class="header" href="#olympiad-numbers">Olympiad Numbers</a></h2>
<p>According to the Watchtower [1, p. 28] [2, pp. 454, CHRONOLOGY]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diodorus of Sicily (c. 80-20 B.C.E.) wrote that Cyrus became king of
Persia in “the opening year of the Fifty-fifth Olympiad.” (Historical
Library, Book IX, 21) That year was 560 B.C.E. The Greek historian
Herodotus (c. 485-425 B.C.E.) stated that Cyrus was killed “after he
had reigned twenty-nine years,” which would put his death during his
30th year, in 530 B.C.E. (Histories, Book I, Clio, 214) Cuneiform
tablets show that Cyrus ruled Babylon for nine years before his death.
Thus, nine years prior to his death in 530 B.C.E. takes us back to 539
B.C.E. as the year Cyrus conquered Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The date of 539 B.C.E. for the fall of Babylon can be arrived at not
only by Ptolemy’s canon but by other sources as well. The historian
Diodorus, as well as Africanus and Eusebius, shows that Cyrus’ first
year as king of Persia corresponded to Olympiad 55, year 1 (560/559
B.C.E.), while Cyrus’ last year is placed at Olympiad 62, year 2
(531/530 B.C.E.). Cuneiform tablets give Cyrus a rule of nine years
over Babylon, which would therefore substantiate the year 539 as the
date of his conquest of Babylon.—Handbook of Biblical Chronology, by
Jack Finegan, 1964, pp. 112, 168-170; Babylonian Chronology, 626
B.C.–A.D. 75, p. 14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diodorus [3, pp. 31, IX21]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyrus became king of the Persians in the opening year of the
Fifty-fifth Olympiad, as may be found in the Library of Diodorus and
in the histories of Thallus and Castor and Polybius and Phlegon and
all others who have used the reckoning by Olympiads. For all these
writers agree as to the date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Herodotus [4, pp. 204, BookI 214]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greater part of the army of the Persians was destroyed, and Cyrus
himself fell, after reigning nine and twenty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Africanus [5, p. 271]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyrus igitur anno imperii sui primo, qui Olympiadis quinquagesimæ
quintæ primus item annus erat, per Zorobabelem, cujus etiam æqualis
idem et socius erat Jesus Josedeci filius, expleta jam septuaginta
annorum summa, populi Judaici partem aliquam primum dimisit, ut apud
Esdram Hebræum historicum legimus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Cyrus was in the first year of his reign which was the fifty-fifth
Olympiad the first year = 560 BC. [6, pp. 156, 288])</p>
<h3 id="uncertainty"><a class="header" href="#uncertainty">Uncertainty</a></h3>
<p>This information alone isn’t sufficiently precise to give us the date
539 BC exactly. As we discussed in <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../judean/principles.html">Principles of
Chronology</a> there are many different ways of
reckoning a king’s regnal years, and the method of counting used in
Persia is not currently known [7, p. 199]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discussions about or references to dating methods in Achaemenid Persia
as a rule assume complete adaptation to the Babylonian system.
Babylonia’s influence on Persia is no doubt momentous. Paraphrasing
Horace (Ep. 2.1.156), one could justifiably say, <em>Babylonia captaferum
victorem cepit</em>. But in this same spirit, Oppenheim observes that the
historian’s task should also be “to gauge the extent and intensity of
the impact of the older civilization on the new empire in the Ancient
Near East, rooted as it was in Iranian soil” (1985, 530). <br><br>
Although Babylonian dominance seems overwhelming with regard to dating
methods, this paper has scoured sources from all over the Achaemenid
Empire in an attempt to detect signs of accession dating in Persia. In
particular, the statements in Thucydides and Nehemiah raise a
challenge as to how else to explain the sources. But the paper also
reveals how woefully scant the evidence is. It is difficult to imagine
what type of source could ever emerge to bring certainty in the matter
here discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with information given by the ancient historians alone (of Cyrus
reign beginning in 560/559 BC, and lasting 29 years), we can only really
say he captured Babylon somewhere around 541-539 BC. Also to further
complicate the issue other sources give Cyrus a 30 year reign instead
[8, pp. 275, XXIII, 46], again this isn’t necessarily a contradiction;
it just depends on how the writers were counting the reign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was told by the magi, who are classed as wise and learned men among
the Persians, that his grasping for the sun three times portended that
he would reign for thirty years! And thus it happened; for he lived to
his seventieth year, having begun to reign at forty.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="contradictions"><a class="header" href="#contradictions">Contradictions</a></h3>
<p>Using the system of Olympiad numbers Africanus also dates the 20th year
of Artaxerxes to 445 BC [9, pp. 135, AfricanusIII XVI]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For from Nehemiah, who was despatched by Artaxerxes to build Jerusalem
in the 115th year of the Persian empire, and the 4th year of the 83d
Olympiad, and the 20th year of the reign of Artaxerxes himself, up to
this date, which was the second year of the 202d Olympiad, and the
16th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, there are reckoned 475
years, which make 490 according to the Hebrew numeration, as they
measure the years by the course of the moon ; so that, as is easy to
show, their year consists of 354 days, while the solar year has
365¼days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>(1st olympiad = 776 BC, 83rd Olympiad = 448 BC, 4th year = 445
BC)</sup></p>
<p>However this is in direct contradiction with the Insight book chronology
chapter, and the Watchtower’s interpretation of Daniel’s 70 weeks
prophesy (Daniel 9:24) [2, pp. 463, CHRONOLOGY]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next date of major importance is the 20th year of Artaxerxes
(Longimanus), the year Nehemiah received permission to go and rebuild
Jerusalem. (Ne 2:1, 5-8) The reasons for favoring the date of 455
B.C.E. for this year as against the popular date of 445 B.C.E. are
considered in the article PERSIA, PERSIANS. The events of this year
that involve the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls mark the
starting point of the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks” at
Daniel 9:24-27. The weeks there are clearly “weeks of years” (Da 9:24,
RS, AT, Mo), totaling 490 years. As demonstrated under the heading
SEVENTY WEEKS, the prophecy pointed to Jesus’ appearance as the
Messiah in the year 29 C.E.; his death at “the half of the week” or in
the middle of the last week of years, that is, in 33 C.E.; and the end
of the period of God’s special favor to the Jews in 36 C.E. Thus, the
70 weeks of years closed with the conversion of Cornelius, 490 years
from the year 455 B.C.E.—Ac 10:30-33, 44-48; 11:1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Africanus also dates the birth of Jesus to 3/2 BC and his death and
resurrection to 29/30 AD [6, p. 158]). However this is also in
contradiction with the Insight book which says [10, pp. 58,
JESUSCHRIST]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus’ birth would come about six months later in the fall of 2
B.C.E., his ministry would start about 30 years later in the fall of
29 C.E., and his death would come in the year 33 C.E. (on Nisan 14 in
the spring, as stated).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Watchtower’s chronology to work it also means dismissing other
reigns and dates given by the same historians <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/egypt/historians.html">for the 26th dynasty of
Egypt</a>, since otherwise Necho could
not have been Pharaoh at the time of the battle of Megiddo or
Carchemish.</p>
<p>In summary the Watchtower doesn’t make clear why the Olympiad numbers
given by the ancient historians for Cyrus’ reign should be trusted,
whilst at the same time implicitly rejecting the other dates that the
historians provide for Persian, Egyptian, and Christian history.</p>
<h2 id="bm-33066"><a class="header" href="#bm-33066">BM 33066</a></h2>
<p>The Watchtower says [1, p. 28] [2, p. 453]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Babylonian astronomical clay tablet (BM 33066) confirms the date of
Cyrus’ death in 530 B.C.E. Though this tablet contains some errors
regarding the astronomical positions, it contains the descriptions of
two lunar eclipses that the tablet says occurred in the seventh year
of Cambyses II, the son and successor of Cyrus. These are identified
with lunar eclipses visible at Babylon on July 16, 523 B.C.E., and on
January 10, 522 B.C.E., thus pointing to the spring of 523 B.C.E. as
the beginning of Cambyses’ seventh year. That would make his first
regnal year 529 B.C.E. So Cyrus’ last year would have been 530 B.C.E.,
making 539 B.C.E. his first year of ruling Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A Babylonian clay tablet is helpful for connecting Babylonian
chronology with Biblical chronology. This tablet contains the
following astronomical information for the seventh year of Cambyses II
son of Cyrus II: “Year 7, Tammuz, night of the 14th, 1 2⁄3 double
hours [three hours and twenty minutes] after night came, a lunar
eclipse; visible in its full course; it reached over the northern half
disc [of the moon]. Tebet, night of the 14th, two and a half double
hours [five hours] at night before morning [in the latter part of
the night], the disc of the moon was eclipsed; the whole course
visible; over the southern and northern part the eclipse reached.”
(Inschriften von Cambyses, König von Babylon, by J. N. Strassmaier,
Leipzig, 1890, No. 400, lines 45-48; Sternkunde und Sterndienst in
Babel, by F. X. Kugler, Münster, 1907, Vol. I, pp. 70, 71) These two
lunar eclipses can evidently be identified with the lunar eclipses
that were visible at Babylon on July 16, 523 B.C.E., and on January
10, 522 B.C.E. (Oppolzer’s Canon of Eclipses, translated by O.
Gingerich, 1962, p. 335) Thus, this tablet points to the spring of 523
B.C.E. as the beginning of the seventh year of Cambyses II. <br><br>
Since the seventh year of Cambyses II began in spring of 523 B.C.E.,
his first year of rule was 529 B.C.E. and his accession year, and the
last year of Cyrus II as king of Babylon, was 530 B.C.E. The latest
tablet dated in the reign of Cyrus II is from the 5th month, 23rd day
of his 9th year. (Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.–A.D. 75, by R.
Parker and W. Dubberstein, 1971, p. 14) As the ninth year of Cyrus II
as king of Babylon was 530 B.C.E., his first year according to that
reckoning was 538 B.C.E. and his accession year was 539 B.C.E.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BM 33066 (Strm. Kambys. 400) (LBAT 1477) is one of the tablets mentioned
in the <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/astro.html">Astronomical Texts</a> section, and
covered in my
<a href="https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm33066.md">astro-tablets</a>
project. It does indeed date the 7th year of Cambyses to 523 BC.</p>
<p>The Watchtower offers the Babylonian <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/business/README.html">Business
Tablets</a> as the sole source for the
length of Cyrus’ reign as king of Babylon, the last tablets being dated
to his 9th year. Counting backwards Babylon must have fallen to Cyrus in
539 BC.</p>
<h3 id="problems"><a class="header" href="#problems">Problems</a></h3>
<p>As we will see later in this chapter (section <a href="watchtower/70_years/../criticisms/README.html">Criticism of Orthodox
Babylonian Chronology</a>) the Watchtower using
these sources as a base for their “Biblical chronology” contradicts
their own arguments; in short:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not clear how the Watchtower can justify using <a href="https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm33066.md">BM
33066</a>
(which has a number of serious inaccuracies [11, p. 7]) to be a
valid source of chronological information, whilst rejecting the
dates of <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/astro.html">seven other astronomical texts</a>.</li>
<li>Using the latest dated business tablet as the only evidence for the
end of Cyrus’ reign doesn’t make much sense given that for the 70
year prophesy to be correct relies on the assumption that the
business tablets do not constitute a “continuous chronological
record”.</li>

<p>The Watchtower accepts the year 539 BC as the date of the fall of
Babylon to Cyrus [1, pp. 453, Chronology] [2, p. 28]. The <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.html">Nabonidus
Chronicle</a> describes the fall in
detail; the Babylonian army was defeated in the 7th month (III, Lines
12-18), and Cyrus entered the city of Babylon on the 3rd day of the 8th
month (III, Line 18), these dates are accepted by the Watchtower [1,
pp. 568, Cyrus] [3, pp. 459, Nabonidus]. Cyrus’ accession was
therefore around the end of October 539 BC, and his first year as king
of Babylon would have began in the spring of 538 BC.</p>
<h2 id="the-watchtowers-date"><a class="header" href="#the-watchtowers-date">The Watchtower’s Date</a></h2>
<p>The Watchtower lists the year 537 BC as the time that the Jews returned
to Jerusalem [1, pp. 458, Chronology] [1, pp. 568, Cyrus]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing the Jews from exile was
given. And, as considered in the article on CYRUS, it is very probable
that the decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward the
spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit the Jews time to make necessary
preparations, effect the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and still
arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri, or about October 1) of 537
B.C.E.—Ezr 1:1-11; 2:64-70; 3:1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return
to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537
B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move
out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip
that could take about four months according to Ezr 7:9) and yet be
settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh month” (Tishri) of
the year 537 B.C.E. (Ezr 3:1, 6) This marked the end of the prophesied
70 years of Judah’s desolation that began in the same month, Tishri,
of 607 B.C.E.—2Ki 25:22-26; 2Ch 36:20, 21.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="alternatives-1"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-1">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>Some historians suggest that Cyrus issued his decree near the start of
his first year, and therefore the exiles had returned by the 7th month
in 538 BC [4, p. 432]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a reasonable hypothesis, therefore, that work was begun on the
Temple site under the direction of Sheshbazzar as soon as the
returning exiles reached Jerusalem, probably in 538 since, though
Cyrus’ first year ran from spring 538 to spring 537, he had taken
Babylon in October 539, and it is unlikely that he would have allowed
any great time to elapse before he issued the decree. According to the
Book of Ezra, Zerubbabel, Joshua the high priest, and others assembled
in Jerusalem in the seventh month. There they built an altar and
re-established the giving of burnt-offerings on it, celebrating in
particular the observances of the festival of Succoth (Booths or
Tabernacles) (Ezra 3:1—6; I Esdras 5:46—52). In the Jewish calendar,
Succoth was kept in the seventh month, Tishri, to mark the time of
harvest (Lev. 23:33-6; Deut. 16:13—15). This strongly suggests that
the ‘seventh month’ in which Zerubbabel built the altar was Tishri in
538, rather than simply the seventh month after the return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand Steinmann argues that it would have taken 5 years from
Cyrus decree before the exiles returned to Jerusalem, which would be 533
BC [5]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it is possible with external information to determine when
Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel led the Judean exiles back to Jerusalem and
the Persian province of Yehud. While five years may seem like a long
time between Cyrus’s decree and the return to Jerusalem, the details
in Ezra 1–2 would seem to indicate that an immediate return would have
been unlikely. First of all, there was a time of preparation to make
the return. Ezra 1:6 indicates a concerted effort by those who
remained in Babylon to help equip and finance the return. This was
probably not a quick process given all that was donated. Second, it is
unlikely that the returnees simply dropped everything in order to
return. There was property to sell, accounts to settle, travel
arrangements to be made. Third, Ezra 2:64–65 and Neh 7:66 indicate
that about 50,000 people made the trip to Jerusalem. Organizing such a
large group would not happen quickly. Finally, it would have been
unlikely that Cyrus’s treasurer Mithredath would have turned over the
temple vessels to any Judean who presented himself as leader of the
returning Judeans, no matter how prominent he may have been (Ezra
1:8). Instead, it is more reasonable to assume that the exiles first
organized themselves and their leaders requested that one of them be
named governor of Yehud and entrusted with the vessels. <br><br> For
these reasons, a five-year period of planning and organization is not
at all unreasonable. Furthermore, this five-year delay explains why,
after making only a beginning by laying the foundation, the Judeans
were forced to stop. Had they returned immediately with the decree of
Cyrus still new, it is unlikely that their building program could have
been successfully opposed in the court of Cyrus as indicated by Ezra
4:5. It simply would be unlikely for the king or his officials to
reverse policy so abruptly and quickly. If, however, the Judeans
returned in 533 BC and began to build in 532 BC during their second
year in Jerusalem, the decree would have been some six years old—long
enough in the past that it was capable of being opposed and allowing
for the opposition to persuade Persian authorities to halt the work.
Thus from the text of Ezra and the evidence of the sabbatical year
cycles of the post-exilic era we can be reasonably certain that
Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel and the people with them returned in 533
BC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore as we have already seen the Watchtower is assuming that the
Bible writers were counting the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, inclusive of his accession year [3, pp. 481, NEBUCHADNEZZAR]
(see section <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../judean/solutions/watchtower.html">Watchtower Judean
Chronology</a>). We must therefore
ask if the Bible writers were doing the same when they refer “the first
year of Cyrus”; could the edict have been issued as early as the October
of 539 BC up to Nisan in 538 BC?</p>
<h2 id="issues-1"><a class="header" href="#issues-1">Issues</a></h2>
<p>As we have seen the date that the exiles returned to Jerusalem is used
by the Watchtower to calculate the destruction of Jerusalem (by counting
back 70 years). How can the Watchtower be so sure that this date was 537
BC and not one of the other possibilities? The Watchtower offers two
reasons, however both are invalid [1, pp. 800, Ezrah] [6, p. 80]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 70th year of Jerusalem’s desolation, the last enforced sabbath on
the land, would end in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must
have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in 537 for two reasons.
The desolation had to last until the 70th year ended, and the released
Israelites would not be expected to travel in the winter rainy season,
as would have been the case if the decree had been made a few months
earlier. Likely it was issued in the early spring of 537 B.C.E. in
order to give the Jews a chance to travel during the dry season,
arrive in Jerusalem, and set up the altar on the first day of the
seventh month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September 29 according
to the Gregorian calendar. —Ezr 3:2-6.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jehovah God had decreed that their land should rest without
inhabitants for seventy years. Its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping
began in the early autumn of 538 B.C., about the time of the Jewish
Day of Atonement. Cyrus’ decree of liberation was published in the
first year of his reign. Babylon fell before him in 539 B.C., and
Bible chronologers figure that his first regnal year began in the
spring of the year following, on Nisan 1, 538 B.C., which would be six
months before the seventieth year of sabbath-keeping of the land of
Judah began. If Cyrus had issued his decree early in 538 B.C. as his
first regnal year, the exiled Jews could have made the journey back to
their land before its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping began, which
would have been contrary to Jehovah’s prophecy. Or they might have had
to journey through the rainy winter months of the year, which would be
from October through March. This would not be too good. <br><br> By
the calculation above, Cyrus’ first regnal year would end on March 5
of 537 B.C., or toward the end of the rainy season. Doubtless he
considerately issued his decree near the end of the rainy season,
shortly before March 5 of 537 B.C., and in that way the exiled
Israelites could make arrangements to travel in the convenient dry
season from April through September. They evidently made the
four-month-long journey from Babylon during the dry months, for by
October they were back and settled in their beloved homeland, before
the first day of their seventh lunar month.—Ezra 3:1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first is the speculation that Cyrus must have issued his decree at
the end of the rainy season - even if this were true, we have seen above
that this does not mean the Jews must have returned in 537 BC, for
example Cyrus could have issued his decree in the first few months of
his first year, such that the Jews would have had plenty of time to make
travel to Jerusalem before the 7th month of 538 BC (as described by The
Cambridge Ancient History).</p>
<p>The second reason given is that “The desolation had to last until the
70th year ended” however this is based upon circular reasoning, since
the Watchtower only knows when the 70 years began by counting backwards
from when they ended. As stated in the Watchtower 2011 [2, pp. 27–28]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Did “the Seventy Years” Start? <br>…<br> So this event evidently
marked the starting point of the 70 years. And what year was that? To
answer, we need to see when that period ended.</p>

<p>Requiring a period of 70 years between the destruction of Jerusalem in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 18th/19th year and the return of Jewish captives
(somewhere around) Cyrus’ first year is clearly incompatible with all
the chronological data we have for <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/README.html">the Neo-Babylonian
period</a>. There is no historical evidence to
suggest that this prophesy of 70 years (as interpreted) came true.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-interpretations"><a class="header" href="#alternative-interpretations">Alternative Interpretations</a></h2>
<p>There are some alternative interpretations of Jeremiah’s prophesy that
could in theory satisfy the historical evidence however the Watchtower
has chosen to reject these [1, p. 138] [2, p. 27]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, based primarily on such secular records, some persons figure
that Jerusalem was destroyed in 587/6 B.C.E. and that the Jews came
under Babylonian domination in Nebuchadnezzar’s accession year, which
they calculate as being 605 B.C.E. They thus hold 605 B.C.E. to be the
date when Jeremiah 25:11 began to be fulfilled: “All the land shall be
a desolation; and they shall serve among the Gentiles seventy years.”
(Bagster’s Greek Septuagint) If that were so and the Gentile Times
were counted from then, it would put the end of the prophetic “seven
times” in the World War year of 1916. Yet, as stated, we believe that
there is much stronger reason for accepting the information in God’s
inspired Word, which points to the Gentile Times’ beginning in October
607 B.C.E. and ending in October of 1914 C.E.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of saying 70 years “at Babylon,” many translations read “for
Babylon.” (NIV) Some historians therefore claim that this 70-year
period applies to the Babylonian Empire. According to secular
chronology, the Babylonians dominated the land of ancient Judah and
Jerusalem for some 70 years, from about 609 B.C.E. until 539 B.C.E.
when the capital city of Babylon was captured. <br><br> The Bible,
however, shows that the 70 years were to be a period of severe
punishment from God—aimed specifically at the people of Judah and
Jerusalem, who were in a covenant to obey him. (Exodus 19:3-6) When
they refused to turn from their bad ways, God said: “I will summon …
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon … against this land and its inhabitants
and against all the surrounding nations.” (Jeremiah 25:4, 5, 8, 9,
NIV) While nearby nations would also suffer Babylon’s wrath, the
destruction of Jerusalem and the 70-year exile to follow were called
by Jeremiah “the punishment of my people,” for Jerusalem had “sinned
greatly.”—Lamentations 1:8; 3:42; 4:6, NIV.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="discussion-in-the-awake-2012"><a class="header" href="#discussion-in-the-awake-2012">Discussion in the <em>Awake!</em> 2012</a></h2>
<p>The series “The Bible—A Book of Accurate Prophecy” in the <em>Awake!</em>
magazine attempts to demonstrate the “divine inspiration” of Jeremiah’s
70 year prophesy.</p>
<p>Regarding the 70 year period (Jeremiah 25:11) the <em>Awake!</em> says [3, p.
13]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fulfillment: After an extended siege, Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jerusalem
in 607 B.C.E. He also conquered other Judean cities, including Lachish
and Azekah. (Jeremiah 34:6, 7) He deported most of the survivors to
Babylon, where they were held captive for 70 years.<br> What history
reveals:<br> ● The Bible identifies Nebuchadnezzar as being the king
of Babylon about the time of Jerusalem’s destruction. Archaeological
evidence supports the Bible’s testimony about his existence. A cameo
made of onyx stone is on display in Florence, Italy. It bears an
inscription that says in part: “In honour of Merodach, his lord,
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his life-time had this made.”
Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.<br> ● The book The Bible
and Archaeology says that excavations and surveys in Lachish confirm
the following: “The final destruction was violent, and so fierce was
the fire which destroyed the city [Lachish] that the limestone of
the buildings turned to lime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as we have seen there is no evidence for the dating the
destruction of Jerusalem to 607 BC apart from first assuming the 70 year
prophesy did come true, assuming that the Jews returned in the 2nd year
of Cyrus, and then counting back 70 years from 537 BC.</p>
<p>Then the “What history reveals” contains the statement that
Nebuchadnezzar “ruled from 624 to 582 B.C.E.”, but no historical
evidence for this has been provided (independent of Jeremiah’s prophesy
which this paragraph is trying to prove the accuracy of).</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the exiles (Jeremiah 29:10) the <em>Awake!</em> says
[3, p. 14]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fulfillment: After 70 years of exile, from 607 to 537 B.C.E., King
Cyrus of Persia released the Jewish captives and allowed them to
return to their homeland to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.—Ezra
1:2-4.<br> What history reveals:<br> ● Did the Israelites remain
captive in Babylon for 70 years as the Bible foretold? Note the
comments of a leading Israeli archaeologist, Ephraim Stern. “From 604
B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.—there is a complete gap in evidence suggesting
occupation. In all that time, not a single town destroyed by the
Babylonians was resettled.” The so-called gap in which there was no
occupation or resettling of conquered territory corresponds closely to
Israel’s exile in Babylon from 607 to 537 B.C.E.—2 Chronicles 36:20,
21.<br> ● Ancient nations throughout Mesopotamia wrote on tablets made
of soft clay. One hardened clay tablet, known as the Cyrus Cylinder,
dates back to about 539 B.C.E., the same year that King Cyrus of
Persia overthrew the Babylonian Empire. One inscription reads: “I am
Cyrus, . . . king of Babylon.” The same inscription goes on to report:
“I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other
side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a
long time, the images which (used) to live therein . . . I (also)
gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their
habitations.” This secular source harmonizes with the Bible prophecy
that states that the Jewish exiles would be repatriated to their
homeland—a prophecy recorded about 200 years in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quotation of Stern would appear to be grossly misleading, in full
context he actually says [4, p. 46]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The savage Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem is well documented both
in the Bible (in the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations) and in the
archaeological record. When Nebuchadnezzar first placed the city under
siege in 597 B.C.E., the city quickly capitulated, thereby avoiding a
general destruction. But in response to a revolt by Judah’s King
Zedekiah, Nebuchadnezzar dispatched an army that, after an 18- month
siege, captured and destroyed the city in 586 B.C.E. The evidence of
this destruction is widely confirmed in Jerusalem excavations.
<br><br> On his first swing through Judah, Nebuchadnezzar had
destroyed much of Philistia-Ekron, Tel Barash, Tell Jemmeh, Ruqeish
and Tel Sera’. Particularly devastated was Ashkelon, which the
Babylonians sacked in 604 B.C.E. <br><br> Similar evidence of
Babylonian destruction can be found throughout the Beersheba Valley,
in the Aravah (the valley south of the Dead Sea) and in the Jordan
River valley. From south to north, we can trace the effects of
Babylonian might-at Tell el-Kheleifeh on the coast of the Red Sea, at
Ein Gedi on the shore of the Dead Sea, and further north at Dan, the
source of the Jordan River. The same is true in excavations at major
northern sites Hazor; Megiddo, overlooking the Jezreel Valley; and
Dor, on the Mediterranean coast-and in central Judah, where, in
addition to Jerusalem, we may look at Rarnat Rahel and Lachish, among
other sites. <br><br> But the strange thing is that above the remains
left by these destructions, we find no evidence of occupation until
the Persian period, which began in about 538 B.C.E. For roughly half a
century-from 604 B.C.E. to 538 B.C.E.-there is a complete gap in
evidence suggesting occupation. In all that time, not a single town
destroyed by the Babylonians was resettled. This is true even of the
old Assyrian fortresses along the Way of the Sea (the Via Maris); they
were reoccupied only in the Persian period, as shown by the recently
excavated fort at Rishon le-Zion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further on in his article [4, p. 51]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The destruction of Judah is followed by the Persian period, when,
following the eclipse of the Babylonians by the comparatively benign
Persians, the Jewish exiles were permitted to return to Palestine.
<br><br> I do not mean to imply that the country was uninhabited
during the period between the Babylonian destruction and the Persian
period. There were undoubtedly some settlements, but the population
was very small. Many towns and villages were either completely or
partly destroyed. The rest were barely functioning. International
trade virtually ceased. Only two regions appear to have been spared
this fate-the northern part of Judah (the region of Benjamin) and
probably the land of Ammon, although the latter region awaits further
investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Awake!</em> claims that their 607-537 BC period for a deserted
Jerusalem is supported by Stern’s 604-538 BC period during which cities
destroyed by Babylon were not resettled. However as can be seen Stern
does not believe Jerusalem was destroyed or unoccupied until 586 BC. The
year 604 BC is referring to the Philistine city of Ashkelon being
plundered in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar (see <a href="watchtower/70_years/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> Obv. 18).</p>

<p>Jeremiah’s prophesy is discussed in Chapter 9 “Prophecies That Came
True” [5, p. 120]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>7. How does archaeology testify to the fulfillment of the
prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah concerning Jerusalem?</sup> <br><br>
7 The Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land notes that when the
Babylonian onslaught was over, “the destruction of the city
[Jerusalem] was a total one.” Archaeologist W. F. Albright states:
“Excavation and surface exploration in Judah have proved that the
towns of Judah were not only completely destroyed by the Chaldeans in
their two invasions, but were not reoccupied for generations—often
never again in history.” Thus, archaeology confirms the shocking
fulfillment of this prophecy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst the chapter states that Jeremiah’s prophesy is confirmed by
archaeology, the provided evidence only demonstrates that Jerusalem was
destroyed, not that there was a 70 year period as claimed by the
Watchtower.</p>

‘<em>seven times</em>’.</p>
<p>According to the Proclaimers book the first known interpretation of the
‘<em>seven times</em>’ in Daniel 4 as a prophetic period was published in 1823
by John Aquila Brown in the <em>The Even-Tide</em> [1, p. 134]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As early as 1823, John A. Brown, whose work was published in London,
England, calculated the “seven times” of Daniel chapter 4 to be 2,520
years in length. But he did not clearly discern the date with which
the prophetic time period began or when it would end. He did, however,
connect these “seven times” with the Gentile Times of Luke 21:24.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is actually only partially true since he did in fact give
a beginning and end date [2, p. 135]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commencing, therefore, the calculation of the “seven times,” from the
first year of Nebuchadnezzar A.C. 604, whose kingdom is the golden
head of the image, and is represented by the towering and palmy
“tree,” previously to its desolation, the termination of these 2520
years will fall out in the year 1917.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brown also did not connect the ‘<em>seven times</em>’ of Daniel 4 to Luke 21:24
as claimed by the Watchtower. Instead he identified the Gentile times
with the ‘<em>time, times, and a half</em>’ of Daniel [2, p. XI]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “times of the Gentiles,” during which Jerusalem is to be trodden
down of the Gentiles, as declared by Christ, and by the Apostle Paul,
as well as by the Prophet John, in his vision of the two witnesses,
are therefore unquestionably the “time, times, and a half,” predicted
by the Prophet Daniel, when your desolation is to cease; and he
defines these times to be twelve hundred and sixty days or years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Even Tide</em> was the first of many publications throughout the 19th
century to apply a 2520 year prophetic period to a variety of different
starting points and chronologies. A number of these interpretations
terminated in 1914, the first of which was published in 1844 by E B
Elliott [3, p. 265].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And 1st, on the seven times of Nebuchadnezzar’s insanity and state of
bestialism. These, calculated after the year-day system, on the
hypothesis of the Babylonish king’s insanity figuring that of the
great empires which he then headed, in their state of heathen
aberration from God, (an hypothesis on the truth of which I do not
myself entertain much doubt,) terminate, —if dated from the time, B.C.
727, when the Assyrians under Shalmanezer first acted the wild beast’s
part against Israel,—about the year 1793; that is, at the epoch of the
French Revolution, and the coincident going forth of the
gospel-message to evangelize the heathen: doubtless a very remarkable
synchronism: especially considering that the bisecting point of these
seven times is then A.D. 533; the very commencing epoch, with
Justinian’s Decree, of the three and a half times of the Papal
Antichrist. Of course if calculated from Nebuchadnezzar’s own
accession and invasion of Judah, B.C. 606, the end is much later,
being A.D. 1914; just one half century, or jubilean period, from our
probable date of the opening of the Millennium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section will now track how the Watchtower’s interpretation of the
‘<em>Gentile Times</em>’ prophesy developed and changed over time, starting
with Charles Taze Russell’s publications in the late 19th century.</p>

<p>Charles Taze Russell was the founder of the Watchtower Society and Bible
Student movement. His interpretation of Daniel 4’s ‘<em>seven times</em>’ as a
2520 year prophecy spanning 606 BC to 1914 AD was taken from the
Adventist writer Nelson Barbour.</p>
<p>In the September 1875 edition of <em>Herald of the Morning</em> Barbour wrote
[1, p. 52]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that though the gospel dispensation will end in 1878, the
Jews will not be restored to Palestine, until 1881; and that the
“times of the Gentiles,” viz. their seven prophetic times of 2520, or
twice 1260 years, which began where God gave all, into the hands of
Nebuchadnezzar, 606 B.C.; do not end until A.D. 1914; or 40 years from
this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1876 Russell read this, and spent time discussing it with Barbour
[2, p. 46]. Russell adopted the same views and in the October 1876
edition of <em>Bible Examiner</em> he wrote [3, p. 27]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if three and one-half times are 1260 years, seven times would be twice
as much, i.e. 2520 years. At the commencement of our Christian era.
606 years of time had passed, (70 years captivity, and 536 from Cyrus
to Christ) which deducted from 2520, would show that the seven times
will end in A.D. 1914</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together in 1877 Barbour and Russell published the book <em>Three Worlds,
and The Harvest of This World</em>, in it they reiterated the same
interpretations of the prophesy along with an explanation of the
chronology that it was based on [4, pp. 83, 194]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seventy years captivity ended in the first year of Cyrus, which
was B.C. 536. They therefore commenced seventy years before, or B.C.
606. Hence, it was in B.C. 606, that God’s kingdom ended, the diadem
was removed, and all the earth given up to the Gentiles. 2520 years
from B.C. 606, will end in A.D. 1914, or forty years from 1874.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that the first year of Cyrus was B.C. 536, is based on
Ptolemy’s canon, supported by the eclipses by which the dates of the
Grecian and Persian era have been regulated. And the accuracy of
Ptolemy’s canon is now accepted by all the scientific and literary
world, Hence, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar to the Christian era,
there is but one chronology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell later dedicated an entire chapter of Millennial Dawn (later
renamed as Studies in the Scriptures) Volume II (first published in
1889) to the ‘Gentile times’, he explains [5, p. 79]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bible evidence is clear and strong that the “Times of the
Gentiles” is a period of 2520 years, from the year B.C. 606 to and
including A.D. 1914. This lease of universal dominion to Gentile
governments, as we have already seen, began with Nebuchadnezzar—not
when his reign began, but when the typical kingdom of the Lord passed
away, and the dominion of the whole world was left in the hands of the
Gentiles. The date for the beginning of the Gentile Times is,
therefore, definitely marked as at the time of the removal of the
crown of God’s typical kingdom, from Zedekiah, their last king.
<br><br> According to the words of the prophet (Ezek. 21:25-27), the
crown was taken from Zedekiah; and Jerusalem was besieged by
Nebuchadnezzar’s army and laid in ruins, and so remained for seventy
years—until the restoration in the first year of Cyrus. (2 Chron.
36:21-23.) Though Jerusalem was then rebuilt, and the captives
returned, Israel has, never had another king from that to the present
day. Though restored to their land and to personal liberty by Cyrus,
they, as a nation, were subject successively to the Persians, Grecians
and Romans. Under the yoke of the latter they were living when our
Lord’s first advent occurred, Pilate and Herod being deputies of
Cæsar. <br><br> With these facts before us, we readily find the date
for the beginning of the Gentile Times of dominion; for the first year
of the reign of Cyrus is a very clearly fixed date — both secular and
religious histories with marked unanimity agreeing with Ptolemy’s
Canon, which places it B.C. 536. And if B.C. 536 was the year in which
the seventy years of Jerusalem’s desolation ended and the restoration
of the Jews began, it follows that their kingdom was overthrown just
seventy years before B.C. 536, i.e., 536 plus 70, or B.C. 606. This
gives us the date of the beginning of the Times of the Gentiles—B.C.
606.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="issues-2"><a class="header" href="#issues-2">Issues</a></h2>
<h3 id="ptolemys-canon"><a class="header" href="#ptolemys-canon">Ptolemy’s canon</a></h3>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="watchtower/history/../../orthodox/canon.html">Ptolemy’s canon</a> section, the
canon shows the first year of Cyrus was 538 BC and not 536 BC as claimed
by Russell.</p>
<p>Furthermore if Russell had actually read the text he would have seen
that the canon gives Nebuchadnezzar’s 1st year as 604 BC. which is
incompatible with his belief in a 70 year exile.</p>
<h3 id="year-zero"><a class="header" href="#year-zero">Year Zero</a></h3>
<p>Russell made an error in his calculation of 2520 years from 606 BC,
since there was no year zero, it should actually terminate at 1915, not
1914!</p>
<p>An article in the Watchtower 1912 discusses this issue in detail, it
starts with the statement that ‘we may not be sure’ if there was a year
zero or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So matters continued with little effort to arrange an exact chronology
of human history, until the Sixth Century A.D. when Dionysius, a Roman
abbot, set forth our present method of counting, styled the Christian
Calendar. It undertook to mark the beginning of the Christian era with
the birth of Christ, reckoned as January 1st. Previous history was
reckoned and styled Before Christ (B.C.) and subsequent history was
styled Anne Domini (A.D.)—in the year of our Lord. <br><br> Whether
Dionysius began his A.D. period January 1st, A.D. 1, or whether he
began it January 1st, A.D. 0, we may not be sure; neither may we feel
too certain whether he began the B.C. dates December 31st, B.C. 0, or
December 31st, B.C. 1. For all ordinary purposes this question would
be rather immaterial. But it has a very important bearing on our
calculation of Gentile Times. [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again this is still incorrect - it is a fact there was no year 0,
Dionysius began his calendar from 1 BC. The article ends with an extract
from a sermon given by Russell in 1904 [6]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of our readers will recall our reference to this subject in a
sermon preached at Allegheny, Pa., January 11, 1904. and published in
the <em>Pittsburgh Gazette</em>. We make an extract from that sermon as
follows:— <br><br> “We find, then, that the Seven Times of Israel’s
punishment and the Seven Times of Gentile dominion are the same; and
that they began with the captivity of Zedekiah, and, as will be seen
from the Chart, they terminate with the year 1915. According to the
best obtainable evidences on the subject, synchronized with the
Scriptural testimony, Zedekiah’s captivity took place in October, 605¾
years before A.D. 1. If we will add to this 1914¾ years, we will have
the year, October, 1915, as the date for the end of Gentile supremacy
in the world—the end of the lease of 2,520 years, which will not be
renewed. Instead, he whose right the kingdom is, shall take possession
of it. This, therefore, marks when the Lord himself shall assume
control of the world’s affairs, to end its reign of sin and death, and
to bring in the True Light.” <br><br> There surely is room for slight
differences of opinion on this subject and it behooves us to grant
each other the widest latitude. The lease of power to the Gentiles may
end in October, 1914, or in October, 1915. And the period of intense
strife and anarchy “such as never was since there was a nation” may be
the final ending of the Gentile Times or the beginning of Messiah’s
reign. [See Vol. 2, SCRIPTURE STUDIES.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the March 1915 Watchtower changes to the Studies in the Scriptures
series were listed, including some replacements of 1914 with 1915 [7]
[8]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call attention to a few slight changes which have been made in four
pages of Vol. II. and six pages of Vol. III., “Studies in the
Scriptures.” These are all trivial and do not alter the real sense and
lesson, but conform to the facts as we have them today… <br><br> Vol
II., page 77, lines 16, 17, “end of A.D. 1914,” reads “end of the
overthrow.” <br><br> Vol II., page 81, line 9, “can date only from
A.D. 1914,” reads “could not precede A.D. 1915.” <br><br> Vol II.,
page 221, line 25, “full favour until A.D. 1914” reads “full favour
until after 1915.”</p>

<p>Chapter 18 ‘<em>Seven Times</em>’ of the 1943 book <em>The Truth Shall Make You
Free</em> make some changes to the chronology regarding the ‘<em>Gentile
times</em>’ attempting to maintain the 606 BC to 1914 AD dates whilst
dealing with the year zero issue created by Russel and Barbour’s
miscalculation [1, pp. 237–239].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This makes it clear that the “seven times” began with Nebuchadnezzar’s
overturning of Jehovah’s typical Theocracy at Jerusalem, in 606 B.C.
As long as the typical administration of God at Jerusalem operated at
all, even imperfectly, in his name, that long there was some measure
of national sanity and a partial exhibition of right rule among
nations on this earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Nebuchadnezzar’s time the year began counting from the fall of the
year, or about October 1, our time. Since he destroyed Jerusalem in
the summer of 606 B.C., that year had its beginning in the fall of 607
B.C. and its ending in the fall of 606 B.C. <br><br> Inasmuch as the
count of the Gentile “seven times” began its first year at the fall of
607 B.C., it is simple to calculate when they end. From the fall of
607 B.C. to the fall of B.C. 1 is exactly 606 years. From the fall of
B.C. 1 to the fall of A.D. 1 is one year, do not forget. Hence from
the fall of B.C. 1 to the fall of A.D. 1914 is 1,914 years. Add now
606 years and 1,914 years, and the sum total is 2,520 years, ending in
the fall of A.D. 1914. By this method Jehovah, who is an accurate
Timekeeper as to his purposes, symbolically foretold that the ”times
of the Gentiles”, that is, the ”seven times”, would continue and
extend to the fall of A.D. 1914.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And regarding the date of Cyrus’s first year, they remain unchanged on
the year 536 BC [1, p. 151].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is well established that two years after the overthrow of Babylon
in 538 B.C. by Darius the Mede and his nephew, Cyrus the Persian, the
first year of Cyrus’ exclusive rule began, which year was 536 B.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="issues-3"><a class="header" href="#issues-3">Issues</a></h2>
<h3 id="tishri-reckoning"><a class="header" href="#tishri-reckoning">Tishri Reckoning</a></h3>
<p>The first statement that “in Nebuchadnezzar’s time the year began” in
Tishri is slightly concerning because it doesn’t specify who’s reign
they are referring to. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar himself and the
Babylonian empire they certainly used Nisan and not Tishri reckoning, on
the other hand in Judah the situation is much less clear as was
discussed in the <a href="watchtower/history/../../judean/README.html">Judean Chronology</a> section.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the regnal year began in the 1st or 7th month, we
know from the Bible (2 Kings 25:3-7) that the walls of Jerusalem were
broken and king Zedekiah captured in the 4th month (Summer), which
according to the <em>Truth</em> book was Summer 606 BC. Counting 2520 years
from Jerusalem’s destruction in Summer 606 BC would bring us to Summer
1915 AD, yet the <em>Truth</em> book instead insists on counting 2520 years
from the start of that regnal year in Autumn 607 BC (which adds up to
Autumn 1914 AD).</p>
<p>But using this calculation would appear to contradict the earlier
paragraph where it was said that ‘<em>as long as the typical administration
of God at Jerusalem operated at all, even imperfectly</em>’ the ‘<em>seven
times</em>’ could not begin, so by starting the count in Autumn 607 BC, they
are neglecting to count the 10 additional months of Zedekiah’s
administration operating in Jerusalem.</p>
<h3 id="cyrus-first-year"><a class="header" href="#cyrus-first-year">Cyrus First Year</a></h3>
<p>It is not well established that <em>Darius the Mede</em> overthrew Babylon in
538 BC, he is not known in any historical source other than the Bible
[2, p. 581]. Nor is it well established that <em>Darius</em> ruled for around
two years before being succeeded by Cyrus. The <em>Truth</em> book provides no
evidence for any of these claims.</p>

<p>A year later the Watchtower published <em>The Kingdom Is At Hand</em> making
further changes to the chronology.</p>
<p>The date for Jerusalem’s destruction remains unchanged from 606 BC [1,
p. 171]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following chronology shows the date of Jerusalem’s destruction as
in the year 607 before Christ. This recognizes the fact that the
ancient reckoning of the vulgar year began in the fall. In other
words, the vulgar year 606 B.C. really began in the fall of 607 B.C.
As stated on page 239 (¶1) of “The Truth Shall Make You Free”:
“Inasmuch as the count of the Gentile ‘seven times’ began its first
year at the fall of 607 B.C., it is simple to calculate when they end.
From the fall of 607 B.C. to the fall of B.C. 1 is exactly 606 years.
… Hence from the fall of B.C. 1 to the fall of A.D. 1914 is 1,914
years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the dates for the fall of Babylon and Cyrus’ first year have
been shifted back by 1 year [1, p. 195]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the most accurate histories, Darius the Mede and Cyrus
the Persian, his nephew, jointly took the capital of the Babylonian
empire in 539 B.C. After Darius’ brief rule there, Cyrus came to
power, in 537 B.C. That year marked the end of the seventy years’
desolation of Jerusalem, and that very year Jehovah God stirred up the
heart of Cyrus to let his captives go free.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="issues-4"><a class="header" href="#issues-4">Issues</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Kingdom</em> book is now using the correct year — 539 BC for Babylon’s
fall, but they are still insistent on two years rule for <em>Darius the
Mede</em> before Cyrus’ first year began. Unfortunately no evidence is
provided to show where they got these dates from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible time-table connects up with the timetable of mundane history
at the first year of Cyrus the Great, king of Persia. Cyrus, together
with his uncle Darius the Mede, overthrew the empire of Babylon. On
this the 1944 edition of <em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em>
says in its table under “Chronology” (page 108): “B.C. 539 Cyrus takes
Babylon.” <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> of 1929 also says under “Cyrus
the Great” (page 373): “In 546 he conquered Crœsus, the rich and
powerful king of Lydia, and in 539 took Babylon, which did not offer
much resistance, being torn by internal dissensions.” The
<em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (eleventh edition, of 1910) says under
“Cyrus the Great” (page 707): “Why the war with Babylon, which had
become inevitable, was delayed until 539, we do not know. Here too
Cyrus in a single campaign destroyed a mighty state. The army of
Nabonidus was defeated; Babylon itself attempted no resistance, but
surrendered on the 16th Tishri (10th of October) 539, to the Persian
general Gobryas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However there is a contradiction in using these sources, since every
single one of them also gives the date of Jerusalem’s destruction as 586
B.C.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em>: in the very same page the
Watchtower has quoted from it also lists the Temple of Jerusalem
being destroyed in the 5th month of 586 BC [2, p. 108].</li>
<li><em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1924 edition): “As Zedekiah who
succeeded Jehoiakin in the latter’s exile entered into a treaty with
Egypt Nebuchadnezzar’s army besieged and captured Jerusalem a second
time, carrying off Zedekiah into captivity (586 B.C.)” [3, p. 34].</li>
<li><em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (11th edition): “Zedeklah’s revolt in 588
B.C led to another siege of Jerusalem, which was taken and destroyed
in 586 B.C.” [4, p. 332].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-cyrus-first-year"><a class="header" href="#on-cyrus-first-year">On Cyrus’ first year</a></h2>
<p>The Watchtower is still insistent that “<em>Darius the Mede</em>” became king
of Babylon after its fall [1, p. 328]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Gobryas is frequently identified as Darius the Mede. Daniel 9:1
and 11:1 speak of “the first year of Darius” as “king over the realm
of the Chaldeans”. Babylon was overthrown in October of 539 B.C., but
the ordinary Babylonian reckoning of a king’s reign was from the 1st
of the month Nisan in the spring of the year. Hence the months from
October of 539 to Nisan 1, 538 B.C., were referred to as the
“beginning of kingship”. The first full year of Darius would therefore
be from Nisan 1, 538 B.C., to the end of the month Adar in 537 B.C.,
or, about, March 24, 538, to March 11, 537 B.C., Julian Calendar (or,
March 18, 538, to March 5, 537 B.C., Gregorian Calendar).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this time they offer two different theories on when “the first year
of Cyrus” began; either that his first year began in Nisan 538 BC as a
co-regency with “<em>Darius the Mede</em>” [1, p. 328]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first year of Cyrus is now usually given as 538 B.C. So if Cyrus
reigned along with Darius, the first full year of Cyrus allowed more
than two months in 537 B.C., for Cyrus to issue his decree for
rebuilding the temple at Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or alternatively that it began in 537 BC after “<em>Darius the Mede</em>” had
ruled for one year [1, p. 328]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if Cyrus succeeded to Darius during or right after Darius’ first
year, then the first full year of Cyrus would run from Nisan 1, 537
B.C., to the end of Adar, 536 B.C., or, about, March 12, 537, to March
29, 536 B.C., Julian Calendar (or, March 6, 537, to March 23, 536
B.C., Gregorian Calendar). This would allow sufficient months in the
year 537 B.C. for Cyrus’ decree to get over all his kingdom, for
contributions for the temple building to be made, for preparations and
the journey to Jerusalem to be made by the Israelites, and for them to
settle in their cities before the first day of the seventh month
(Tishri) in 537 B.C. -Ezra 1: 1; 2: 68-70; 3: 1, 6. See the footnote.
‡</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first theory they state that Cyrus issued his decree near the
<strong>end of his first year</strong> (approx Jan-Mar 537 BC), whereas in the second
theory they state Cyrus must have issued his decree near the <strong>start his
first year</strong> (approx Apr-Jun 537 BC). The footnote does in fact
acknowledge the reason behind this strange contradiction and insistence
on the 537 BC date regardless of when Cyrus’ first year actually began
[1, p. 328]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‡ We hold to the year 537 B.C. as the year for the resettlement of the
remnant of faithful Jews in Jerusalem and Judea. It is on the basis of
this resettlement that the 70 years of desolation of their land is
calculated as having begun in 607 B.C. Whether the time of their
arrival and resettlement there be reckoned as in the first or the
second full year of Cyrus’ reign makes no difference. In either case,
as above shown, Cyrus’ decree and the Jews’ resettlement could both be
in 537 B.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very similar to what we found in section <a href="watchtower/history/../70_years/return.html#issues">Return of the
Exiles</a>; it is a form of circular
reasoning:</p>
<p>Assumption A: “Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 BC because this is 70
years before the return of the exiles in 537 BC”.</p>
<p>Assumption B: “The exiles returned in 537 BC (and not 538 BC or 536+ BC)
because it is 70 years after Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 BC”.</p>

<p>The 1952 May 1st issue of the Watchtower [1] finally acknowledges some
of the past errors we have pointed out, and settles on the dates that
are still held to today.</p>
<h2 id="errors-acknowledged"><a class="header" href="#errors-acknowledged">Errors Acknowledged</a></h2>
<p>Russell miscounting the year zero is admitted [1, p. 271]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point some will inquire why Charles T. Russell in 1877 used
the date 606 B.C. for the fall of Jerusalem whereas The Watchtower of
late years has been using 607 B.C. This is because, in the light of
modern scholarship, two slight errors were discovered to have been
made which cancel each other out and make for the same result, namely,
1914. Concerning the first error, Russell and others considered 1 B.C.
to A.D. 1 as being two years whereas in fact this is only one year
because, as has been said above, there is no “zero” year in the
B.C.-A.D. system for counting years. “The Christian era began, not
with no year, but with a 1st year.”—The Westminster Dictionary of the
Bible, p. 102.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell began his count from 536 B.C. which he claimed was Cyrus’ first
year. Now Cyrus’ first year is accepted to be 538 B.C. although the
count is actually started in Cyrus’ second year 537 B.C [1, p. 271].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second error had to do with not beginning the count of the 2,520
years at the right point in view of historic facts and circumstances.
Almost all early Bible chronology ties in with secular history at the
year 539 B.C., in which year the fall of Babylon to Darius and Cyrus
of the Medes and the Persians occurred. <br>…<br> Cyrus’ first regnal
year is mentioned and was determined to have begun March 17-18, 538
B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C. It was in this first
regnal year of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to
return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. (Ezra 1:1) The decree may
have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4-5, 537 B.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again as we have already noted in section <a href="watchtower/history/../70_years/return.html">Return of the
Exiles</a> no valid justification as to how we can
be sure Cyrus’ edict was given at the end (rather than the start) of his
first year, and that the Jews therefore returned by the 7th month of his
second year.</p>
<h2 id="chronological-sources"><a class="header" href="#chronological-sources">Chronological Sources</a></h2>
<p>This time instead of quoting encyclopedias for the date of Cyrus’ reign
/ the fall of Babylon the Watchtower says [1, p. 271]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one tablet known as the “Nabunaid Chronicle” gives the date for
the fall of Babylon which specialists have ascertained as being
October 12-13, 539 B.C., Julian Calendar, or October 6-7, 539 B.C.,
according to our present Gregorian Calendar.* <br>…<br> However, in
another cuneiform tablet called “Strassmaier, Cyrus No. 11” Cyrus’
first regnal year is mentioned and was determined to have begun March
17-18, 538 B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C.†
<br><br><sup> *History of the Persian Empire, by Olmstead, 1948,

<br> †Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 45, by Parker and
Dubberstein, 1942, pp. 11, 27.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as we saw in section <a href="watchtower/history/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm35382.html">Nabonidus
Chronicle</a> the text contains no
such dates on the Julian (or Gregorian) calendar. It only states that
Persian forces entered the city on the 16th Tishri (likely the 17th year
of Nabonidus, although the text is damaged), therefore these writers
must have got the year 539 B.C. from some other source.</p>
<p>Finegan uses Parker and Dubberstein’s tables to match the Nabonidus
chronicle’s dates to October 539 B.C. [2, p. 190]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On October 13, 539 B.C. Babylon fell to Cyrus the Persian. The date is
given by the Nabunaid chronicle which also tells that Sippar fell to
the Persian forces on October 11 and that Cyrus entered the city of
Babylon in person on October 29<sup>11</sup>. <br><br> <sup>11 Parker
and Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 45 p.11</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olmstead also cites Parker and Dubberstein’s chronology and ancient
historians such as Berossus [3, p. 50]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nabu-naid fled, and on October 13, 539, Gobryas, governor of Gutium,
and the troops of Cyrus entered Babylon without battle. Afterward,
when Nabu-naid returned to Babylon, he was made prisoner.
<sup>97</sup> <br><br> <sup>97 Chron., col. III, II. 12-16; for
chronology see Parker and Dubberstein, op. cit., p. 11; Herod. i. 178,
188 ff.; Xen. Cyrop. vii. 5; Berossus, Frags. 52-54(S)</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we look at Parker and Dubberstein’s <em>Babylonian Chronology</em> however
we see [4, p. 8]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general basis for the chronology of the period here treated is
furnished by the Ptolemaic Canon, with help from classical sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their tables (and Ptolemy’s canon) of course also date the 18th/19th
year of Nebuchadnezzar to 587/576 B.C. thereby contradicting the
Watchtower’s chronology [4, p. 26].</p>
<p>Likewise it is a similar situation for <em>Strassmaier, Cyrus No. 11</em> which
is merely a receipt dated to 1/IV Year 1 of Cyrus [5, p. 9] [6], it
is essentially irrelevant to computing the date of Cyrus’ reign on the
Julian calendar.</p>

<p>The chronology is once again discussed in the February 1955 Questions
from Readers [1].</p>
<h2 id="chronological-sources-1"><a class="header" href="#chronological-sources-1">Chronological Sources</a></h2>
<p>Just like the 1952 Watchtower before it, this article seems to claim the
539 B.C. date for Babylon’s fall can be derived from the Nabonidus
chronicle [1, p. 94]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The outstanding Absolute date for the B.C. period of the Hebrew
Scriptures is that for the fall of Babylon as the capital city of the
third world power at the hands of Cyrus, king of the Persians, October
13, 539 B.C., Julian calendar (or October 7 by our present Gregorian
calendar), which event is referred to at Isaiah 45:1. This date is
made Absolute by reason of the archaeological discovery and
deciphering of the famous Nabunaid Chronicle, which itself gives a
date for the fall of Babylon and which figure specialists have
determined equals October 13, 539 B.C., according to the Julian
calendar of the Romans.† <br><br> <sup>† Babylonian Chronology 626
B.C.—A.D. 45, by Parker and Dubberstein, 1942, p. 11.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And likewise regarding Cyrus’ first year and the return of the exiles
[1, p. 94]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, a clay tablet has been found dated what amounts to our April
4, 538 B.C., indicating Cyrus’ first regnal year.* Therefore Cyrus’
issuing of the decree for the return of the Jews must have taken place
before April, 537 B.C., and this would give the Jews plenty of time to
travel back to Jerusalem by the fall of 537 B.C., to rebuild the altar
as the first step in rebuilding the temple.—See Ezra 3:1, 2. <br><br>
<sup>* Strassmaier, Cyrus, tablet No. 11.</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as has already been seen in section <a href="watchtower/history/./1952.html">The Watchtower
1952</a> both the Nabonidus chronicle and Strassmaier, Cyrus
No. 11 cannot provide us with the date 539 B.C. Instead the dates
contained within are mapped to the Julian calendar with the use of
Parker and Dubberstein’s tables, which are in turn based on Ptolemy’s
canon [2, p. 8] and contradict the Watchtower’s chronology.</p>
<h2 id="c-t-russell"><a class="header" href="#c-t-russell">C T Russell</a></h2>
<p>The article then goes on to falsely state [1, p. 94]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jehovah’s witnesses from 1877 up to and including the publishing of
“The Truth Shall Make You Free” of 1943 considered 536 B.C. as the
year for the return of the Jews to Palestine, basing their
calculations for the fall of Babylon on secular histories that were
inaccurate, not up to date on archaeological evidences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as we have already seen in the section <a href="watchtower/history/./russell.html">Russell and Barbour
(1875+)</a> the 536 B.C. date did not arrive from inaccurate
histories, but rather the incorrect reading of Ptolemy’s canon by
Russell and Barbour (who claimed it listed 536 B.C. as Cyrus’ first year
when in fact it states 538 B.C., see <a href="watchtower/history/../../orthodox/canon.html">Ptolemy’s
Canon</a>).</p>

<p>The sources for dating the fall of Babylon to 539 B.C. are covered
extensively in the article <em>The Book of Truthful Historical Dates</em>
[1].</p>
<h2 id="the-nabonidus-chronicle"><a class="header" href="#the-nabonidus-chronicle">The Nabonidus Chronicle</a></h2>
<p>Thw Watchtower again claims that the Nabonidus chronicle may be used to
determine the date 539 B.C [1, p. 490].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fixing of 539 B.C.E. as the year when this historical event
occurred is based on a stone document known as the Nabonidus
(Nabunaid) Chronicle. This important find was discovered in ruins near
the city of Baghdad in 1879, and it is now preserved in the British
Museum. A translation of this finding was published by Sidney Smith in
Babylonian Historical Texts Relating to the Capture and Downfall of
Babylon, London, 1924, and reads in part: <br><br> “In the month of
Tashritu [Tishri, Hebrew 7th month], when Cyrus attacked the army of
Akkad in Opis on the Tigris, the inhabitants of Akkad revolted, but he
(Nabonidus) massacred the confused inhabitants. The 14th day, Sippar
was seized without battle. Nabonidus fled. The 16th day [October
11-12, 539 B.C.E., Julian, or October 5-6, Gregorian] Gobryas
(Ugbaru), the governor of Gutium and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon
without battle. Afterwards Nabonidus was arrested in Babylon when he
returned (there). . . . In the month of Arahshamnu [Heshvan, Hebrew
8th month], the 3rd day [October 28-29, Julian], Cyrus entered
Babylon, green twigs were spread in front of him—the state of ‘Peace’
(Sulmu) was imposed upon the city.”—Ancient Near Eastern Texts
Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton; 1955), James B. Pritchard,
p. 306. <br><br> Please note, the Nabonidus Chronicle gives precise
details as to the time when these events took place. This, in turn,
enables modern scholars, with their knowledge of astronomy, to
translate these dates into terms of the Julian or Gregorian calendars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However as we have already seen in the previous two sections this does
not make sense; the Nabonidus chronicle doesn’t contain a year for the
fall of Babylon, nor any datable astronomical observations.</p>
<p>Further it should be noted that the Julian/Gregorian dates (in square
brackets) were not part of Pritchard’s translation [2, p. 306];
presumably they were added by the author of this Watchtower article.</p>
<p>The next paragraph also directly quotes Parker and Dubberstein’s page on
Nabonidus reign [3, p. 13], but as already stated in the previous
section, their chronology is based upon the Ptolemaic canon which
contradicts the Watchtower’s “Biblical” chronology [3, pp. 10, 18].</p>
<h2 id="encyclopedia-quotations-etc"><a class="header" href="#encyclopedia-quotations-etc">Encyclopedia Quotations etc.</a></h2>
<p>The Watchtower again offers a new set of quotations from 21 sources that
support the 539 B.C. date [1, p. 491]. They also note that this date
has been “generally accepted for the past sixty years” which raises the
question of why their earlier publications such as the <a href="watchtower/history/./1943.html">1943 The Truth
Shall Make You Free</a> were still using incorrect dates for the
fall of Babylon?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognized authorities of today accept 539 B.C.E. without any question
as the year Babylon was overthrown by Cyrus the Great. In addition to
the above quotations the following gives a small sampling from books
of history representing a cross section of both general reference
works and elementary textbooks. These brief quotations also show that
this is not a date recently suggested, but one thoroughly investigated
and generally accepted for the past sixty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However if we look up each of these 21 sources we find:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (14th Edition, 1929): “Zedkiah’s
revolt in 588 B.C. led to another siege of Jerusalem, which was
taken and destroyed in 586 B.C.” [4, p. 185]. (Also see 1972

<li>
<p><em>Readings in Ancient History</em> (1913): The Watchtower quotation
appears to be in <strong>error</strong> since I cannot find it in the cited
publication [9, p. 64]. It is possible that this was confused with
another publication by H Webster: <em>Early European History</em> (1917)
where the exact quote can instead be found on page 38. The pages
before also say “He captured Jerusalem in 586 B.C.” [10, p. 36].</p>

<p><em>History of the Hebrews</em> (1914): “In July, 586 B.C., a year and a
half after the first appearance of the Chaldeans (II Ki. 25: 1-3), a
breach was made in the wall of Jerusalem” [12, p. 198].</p>
