<p>The aim of this book is to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do historians claim the destruction of Jerusalem took place in
587/586 BC?</li>
<li>Why is there an uncertainty between 587 and 586 BC?</li>
<li>Why do Jehovah's Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem
actually took place in 607 BC?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-the-author"><a class="header" href="#about-the-author">About the Author</a></h2>
<p>My name is Jacob Halsey, I am a software engineer / computer scientist.
My interest in this topic stems from being encouraged by friends and
family to research the Biblical prophecies of Daniel, and from having
read the &quot;Daniel Book&quot; [1] many years ago. I am not (and have never
been) a baptised member of Jehovah's Witnesses myself.</p>

<p>The date of the destruction of Jerusalem is used as the foundation of a
very important belief to Jehovah’s Witnesses - the &quot;end of the Gentile
Times&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Gentile times&quot; is an interpretation of a prophesy found in Luke
21:24 combined with Daniel chapter 4. These times are believed to be
2520 years long, starting from the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BC
and ending in 1914 AD [1, p. 215].</p>
<p>According to the Watchtower 1986 [2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approved association with Jehovah’s Witnesses requires accepting the
entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, including those
Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. What do
such beliefs include? ... That 1914 marked the end of the Gentile
Times and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as
well as the time for Christ’s foretold presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition the &quot;end of the Gentile Times&quot; in 1914 is also used as a
prerequisite to a number of other interpretations of prophesy in the
&quot;Time of the End&quot; [3, p. 286]:</p>
<p>Daniel 12:7: &quot;a time, times and half a time&quot; is interpreted as a period
of 1260 days running from December 1914 (release of 1915 year text) to
21 June 1918 (the sentencing of J F Rutherford and other directors of
the Watch Tower Society) [4, p. 9].</p>
<p>Daniel 12:11: &quot;1290 days&quot; is counted from the January 1919 (the proposal
of the League of Nations) until September 1922 (Bible student convention
at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A).</p>
<p>Daniel 12:12: &quot;the 1,335 days&quot; is counted from September 1922 (see
above) until May 1926 (adoption of &quot;A Testimony to the Rulers of the
World&quot;, at the London convention).</p>

<p>The Babylonian calendar was made up of 12 lunar months. The year starts
at Nisanu in the Spring; within about 30 days of the vernal equinox [1,
p. 131]. However 12 lunar months are about 11 days short of a year, so
in order to prevent the months from drifting through the seasons, an
intercalary 13th month, either a second Ululu (VI₂) or a second Addaru
(XII₂), was occasionally inserted by decree of the King. Prior to
approx. 475 BC this was done at irregular intervals, a list of known
intercalary months is contained in Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D.
75 [2, p. 4].</p>
<p>The Babylonian day began at sunset. Each month starts &quot;when the thin
crescent of the new moon was first visible in the sky at sunset&quot; [2, p.
1]. The moon becomes visible between about 15 to 48 hours after
conjunction (at Mediterranean latitudes), although first sighting may
also be delayed by weather conditions, but not by more than one day [1,
p. 131].</p>
<h2 id="julian-and-gregorian-calendars"><a class="header" href="#julian-and-gregorian-calendars">Julian and Gregorian Calendars</a></h2>
<p>The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE [3].
However the primary calendar used today is the Gregorian calendar, named
after Pope Gregory XII who introduced it in October 1582. It is a minor
refinement to the Julian calendar with the aim of bringing the length of
an average year closer to an actual solar year, it does so by modifying
the rules used for choosing leap years.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar uses the following rule: &quot;Every year that is
exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are
exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if
they are exactly divisible by 400.&quot; the mean length is therefore
365.2425 days. Whereas the Julian calendar has a leap year every 4 years
and therefore has a 365.25 day mean length. The actual solar year is
approx. 365.2422 days.</p>
<p>In addition to changing the leap years, the Gregorian calendar was
offset by a 10 days to restore the date of Easter to the time which it
would have been celebrated by early church. In the 20th and 21st century
the Julian calendar would be about 13 days ahead of the Gregorian
calendar. Note that whilst the Gregorian calendar was quickly adopted in
Roman Catholic Europe, it took some time before the rest of the world
followed. It was adopted in Great Britain in 1752 and was not adopted in
most of Eastern Europe until the early 20th century.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar"><a class="header" href="#mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar">Mapping Babylonian dates to the Julian calendar</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of astronomy and historical dating it is standard
practice to use the Julian calendar when dealing with dates prior to 15
October 1582, and the Gregorian calendar for later dates. All calendar
dates that are used in this book when discussing the Neo-Babylonian era
will therefore be using the Julian calendar.</p>
<p>Also note that the year 0 BC / AD did not exist - rather the years
progress from 1 BC directly to 1 AD. Therefore when using negative years
there will be a 1 year difference; for example the year -100 is the same
year as 101 BC.</p>

<p>This chapter will look at some of the sources from which historians can
determine the chronology of the Neo-Babylonian period.</p>
<p>By doing so I will indirectly answer the first question (why historians
claim the destruction took place in 586/587 BC) by showing the dates for
the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II.</p>

<p>Concerning the early chronicles Grayson says [1, p. 14]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion it may be stated that Chronicles 1-7 represent only a
small part of a series of late Babylonian chronicles which, like all
chronicles of category A, were probably resumes or extracts made from
running accounts which were sometimes kept on writing-boards and these
running accounts were probably identical with astronomical diaries.
The narrative exhibits a narrow outlook restricted to matter of
concern to Babylonia, but within these confines the authors are
objective. Their main concern is to record what actually happened.
Thus one may use these documents as source material for the history of
the period with considerable confidence in their reliability.</p>

<p>The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for
administrative, legal, and economic purposes. By looking at the dates
that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were
from, can show us useful chronological information.</p>
<p>For example the dates have been used in the following publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [1, p. 10]</li>
<li>A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [2]
[3]</li>
<li>Part II: A Survey of Babylonian Texts, 626-605 B.C. [4]</li>
</ul>
<p>A more complete survey has been published by J Everling [5],
originally available
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030207180625/http://www.nexus.hu:80/enkidu/enkidu.html">here</a>
in text format. From the survey I have generated bar charts counting the
tablets dated to each year of each King's reign.</p>
<h3 id="shamash-shum-ukin"><a class="header" href="#shamash-shum-ukin">Shamash-shum-ukin</a></h3>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Shamash-shum-ukin.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>28/V/20 - Borsippa, BM 134973 [6] (K.142 [2, p. 36])</li>
<li>30/V/20 - Babylon, BM 40577 [7] (K.143 [2, p. 36])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years.</p>
<h3 id="kandalanu"><a class="header" href="#kandalanu">Kandalanu</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>6/X/1 - Babylon, VAT 2963 (L.1 [2, p. 39])</li>
<li>10/XII/1 - Sippar?, BM 49326 [8] (L.2 [2, p. 39])</li>
</ul>

<li>2/VIII/22 - Babylon, BM 40039 [13] <strong>&quot;After Kandalanu&quot;</strong> [12, p.
91]</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Kandalanu died somewhere between month
III and VIII of his 21st year, and that during the 22nd year there was
no other king in Babylon.</p>

<li>22/VI/Acc - Sippar? BM 49656 [15]</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Wiseman: [12, p. 93]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chronicle (B.M. 25127, 11. I4-I5) expressly states that
Nabopolassar sat on the throne of Babylon on the 26th of Marcheswan
[VIII] ... Unless a scribal error is assumed it would seem,
therefore, that Nabopolassar was acknowledged king at least at Sippar
which had become independent of Assyria before the final battle at
Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Nabopolassar.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>

<li>20/V/21 - ?, PTS 2761 (T.21.14 [4])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Nabopolassar ruled for 21 years.</p>
<h3 id="nebuchadnezzar-ii"><a class="header" href="#nebuchadnezzar-ii">Nebuchadnezzar II</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>

<li>12/VI/Acc - Uruk?, (YOS 17, 153 [16])</li>
<li>18/VI/Acc - Sippar, BM 49524 [17] [12, p. 84]</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Nebuchadnezzar%20II.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>

<li>26/VI/43 - Uruk, AO 06847 (TCL 12, 58 [18])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Nebuchadnezzar II ruled for 43 years.</p>
<h3 id="amel-marduk"><a class="header" href="#amel-marduk">Amel-Marduk</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>

<li>20/V/Acc - Sippar, BM 75322 [20]</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these texts would overlap with the dates for Nebuchadnezzar II
by one month. R H Sack &quot;proposes that Nebuchadrezzar bought his son into
a co-regency before his death&quot;, which D J Wiseman agrees &quot;is certainly
possible&quot; [21, p. 451].</p>
<p>However D B Weisberg disagrees [22, p. 68]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a possible co-regency of Nebuchadnezzar and Amēl-Marduk does not seem
conclusive. ... The dates we have for the end of one rule and the
beginning of another must be used with an understanding of the human
factors that led to their recording. An Uruk scribe still dating texts
to the reign of a deceased king (Nebuchadnezzar) might not have known
what was happening at the court. A Sippar scribe dating texts to
Amēl-Marduk might have picked up the news more quickly.</p>

<p>Note that the last date (month X) is an anomaly since of 23 texts from
Amel-Marduks second year it is the only one dated later than month V.</p>

Nabonidus, Nos. 219,346,361) this tablet is useless for exact dating
purposes.</p>

<pre><code>   Col. I.
1.  I (am) the lady Adda-guppi' mother
2.  of Nabium-na'id, king of Babylon,
3.  votaress of the gods Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
4.  and Sadarnunna, my deities ;
5.  who, from my childhood, have sought after
6.  their godheads. Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar,
7.  king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city
8.  and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and
9.  the people that (were) in it went to ruin.
10. (Now) forasmuch as the shrines of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
11. and Sadarnunna I sought after and was worshipper of their godhead,
12. (and) that I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
13. I had ever in mind his great godhead—daily, without ceasing,
14. of Sin, Šamaš, Ištar, and Adda, so long as I am alive,
15. I (am) their votaress (both) in heaven and earth. My blessings,
16. the goodly things which they gave me, I (too) by day, night, month, and year, gave (back) to them.
17. I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
18. my two eyes were with him, in prayer and humility of face
19. was I bowed before them (and) thus (I prayed), &quot;May thy return
20. to thy city be (vouchsafed) to me, that the people, the black-headed,
21. may worship thy great godhead.&quot; For calming
22. the heart of my god and my goddess, a dress of fine wool, jewels,
23. silver, gold, a new shift, perfumes, sweet oil,
24. I applied not to my body, (but in) a torn shift
25. I went clothed, my goings-out were noiseless, I proclaimed
26. their praises : the glory of my city and of my goddess
27. was (ever) set in my heart, I kept watch upon them,
28. anything good of mine I did not omit, but carried it (ever) before them.
29. From the 20th year of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, that I was born (in)
30. until the 42nd year of Aššurbanipal, the 3rd year of Aššur-etillu-ili,
31. his son, the 21st year of Nabopolassar, the 43rd year of Nebuchadrezzar,
32. the 2nd year of Awēl-Marduk, the 4th year of Neriglissar,
33. in 95 years of the god Sin, king of the gods of heaven and earth,
34. (in) which I sought after the shrines of his great godhead,
35. (for) my good doings he looked upon me with a smile
36. he heard my prayers, he granted my saying, the wrath
37. of his heart calmed. Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin
38. which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had
39. regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and
40. Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship
41. he called, and the kingship of Sumer and Akkad
42. from the border of Egypt (on) the upper sea even to the lower sea
43. all the lands he entrusted hither
44. to his hands. My two hands I lifted up and to Sin, king of the gods,
45. reverently with imploration [(I prayed) thus, &quot;Nabu-na'id
46. (my) son, offspring of my womb, beloved of his mother,]
   Col. II.
1.  thou hast called him to the kingship, thou hast pronounced his name,
2.  at the command of thy great godhead may the great gods
3.  go at his two sides, may they make his enemies to fall,
4.  forget not, (but) make good E-h̬ul-h̬ul and the finishing of its foundation(?)&quot;.
5.  When in my dream, his two hands had been laid on, Sin, king of the gods,
6, 7. Spoke to me thus, &quot; With thee I will put into the hands of Nabuna'id, thy son, the return of the gods and the habitation of Harran;
8.  He shall build E-h̬ul-h̬ul, shall perfect its structure, (and) Harran
9.  more than (it was) before he shall perfect and restore it to its place.
10. The hand of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna
11. he shall clasp and cause them to enter E-hul-bul &quot;. The word of Sin,
12. king of the gods, which he spoke to me I honoured, and I myself saw (it fulfilled) ;
13. Nabu-na'id, (my) only son, offspring of my womb, the rites
14. forgotten of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and
15. Sadarnunna he perfected, E-h̬ul-h̬ul
16. anew he built and perfected its structure, Harran more
17. than before he perfected and restored it to its place ; the hand
18. of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna from
19. Šuanna his royal city he clasped, and in the midst of Harran
20. in E-h̬ul-h̬ul the abode of their hearts' ease with gladness
21. and rejoicing he let them dwell. What from former times Sin, king of the gods,
22. had not done and had not granted to anybody (he did) for the love of me
23. who had ever worshipped his godhead, laid hold on the hem of his robe—Sin, king of the gods,
24. uplifted my head and set upon me a good name in the land,
25. long days, years of heart's ease he multiplied upon me.
26. From the time of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, until the 9th year
27. of Nabu-na'id king of Babylon, the son, offspring of my womb
28. 104 years of happiness, with the reverence which Sin, king of the gods,
29. placed in me, he made me flourish, my own self: the sight of my two eyes
30. is clear, I am excellent in understanding, my hand and both feet are sound,
31. well-chosen are my words, meat and drink
32. agree with me, my flesh is goodly, glad is my heart.
33. My descendents to four generations from me flourishing in themselves
34. I have seen, I am fulfilled (with) offspring. O Sin, king of the gods, for favour
35. thou hast looked upon me, thou hast lengthened my days: Nabuna'id, king of Babylon,
36. my son, to Sin my lord I have devoted him. So long as he is alive
37. let him not offend against thee; the genius of favour, genius of favour which (to be) with me
38. thou hast appointed and they have caused me to attain offspring, with him (too)
39. appoint (them), and wickedness and offence against thy great godhead
40. endure not, (but) let him worship thy great godhead. In the 21 years
41. of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, in the 43 years of Nebuchadrezzar,
42. son of Nabopolassar,a nd 4 years of Neriglissar, king of Babylon,
43. (when) they exercised the kingship, for 68 years
44. with all my heart I reverenced them, I kept watch over them,
45. Nabu-na'id (my) son, offspring of my womb, before Nebuchadrezzar
46. son of Nabopolassar and (before) Neriglissar, king of Babylon, I caused him to stand,
47. daytime and night he kept watch over them
48. what was pleasing to them he performed continually,
49. my name he made (to be) favourite in their sight, (and) like
50. [a daughtero of] their [own] they uplifted my head
   Col. III.
1.  I nourished (their spirits), and incense offering
2.  rich, of sweet savour,
3.  I appointed for them continually and
4.  laid ever before them.
5.  (Now) in the 9th year of Nabu-na'id,
6.  king of Babylon, the fate
7.  of herself carried her off, and

<h2 id="notes-1"><a class="header" href="#notes-1">Notes</a></h2>
<p>There is some uncertainty about the accuracy or interpretation of the
reigns given for the Assyrian kings Ashurbanipal and Ashur-etil-ilani.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Ashur-etil-ilani's reign coincided with the last
4 years of Ashurbanipal [4, p. 138] [5, p. 57], however this would
mean that the total lengths of 95/104 years would be incorrect due to
double counting. Others disagree and believe the inscription does not
contain any error [6].</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is limited evidence to be completely certain about
the chronology of the last Assyrian kings [7, p. 220].</p>

<p>Known as Nabonidus inscription No.8 [1, p. 351] [2, p. 270], or
Inscription No. 1 [3].</p>
<p>First Published: 1896 by Fr V Scheil [4] and also L Messerschmidt
[5].</p>
<h2 id="translation-7"><a class="header" href="#translation-7">Translation</a></h2>
<p>From Col. X [3, p. 107] see also [6, p. 311]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[As to the temples of the gods] whose storehouses [were empty?]
and where they had not established their residence [since.....],
Marduk, my lord, waited for me and entrusted me with the restoration
of the divine cults. He decreed by his pure utterance the appeasement
of the angry gods and my (re)establishment of their dwellings (as a
duty) for my rule. (Concerning) H̬arran (and) the Eh̬ulh̬ul, which had
been lying in ruins for 54 years because of its devastation by the
Medes (who) destroyed the sanctuaries, with the consent of the gods
the time for the reconciliation approached, 54 years, when Sîn should
return to his place. When he returned to his place, Sîn, the lord of
the tiara, remembered his lofty seat, and (as to) all the gods who
left his chapel with him, it is Marduk, the king of the gods, who
ordered their gathering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="key-information-5"><a class="header" href="#key-information-5">Key Information</a></h2>
<p>The temple in Harran was destroyed during the 16th year of Nabopolassar:</p>
<p><a href="orthodox/nabon24.html">Adad Guppi Stele</a> Col i Lines 6-9:
<code>Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and the people that (were) in it went to ruin.</code></p>
<p><a href="orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">Fall of Nineveh Chronicle</a> Lines 58, 63-64:
<code>The sixteenth year: ... The king of Akkad reached Harran and [...] he captured the city. He carried off the vast booty of the city and the temple.</code></p>
<p>Later the <a href="orthodox/nabon24.html">Adad Guppi Stele</a> Col i Lines 37-40 says:
<code>Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship</code>.</p>
<p>According to Tadmor the inscription therefore counts 54 years from the
16th year of Nabopolassar to the accession of Nabonidus [1, p. 355]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 54 years are counted from 610, the sixteenth year of Nabopalassar
(when Sin &quot;was angry with his city and his house and went up to
heaven&quot;), to 556, the accession year of Nabunaid. The special
importance attached to the period of 54 years should not be
surprising; it represents, as Professor A. Sachs kindly informs me,
the complete cycle of the moon (i.e., three 18 year cycles).
Accordingly, &quot;Sin's returning to his place&quot; would mean that the moon
cycle was completed. I believe that this coincidence — Nabunaid's
coming to the throne exactly 54 years after the destruction of Harran
— was interpreted as a most favorable omen, that the moon-god had
become reconciled.</p>

2.  Uhemibre; Son of Re, of his body, his beloved: Necho, living forever, beloved of Apis, son of Osiris.
3.  The day of the interment of this god. This god was conducted in peace to the necropolis, to let him assume his place in his temple in the western desert of
4.  &quot;Life-of-the-Two-Lands,&quot; after there had been done for him all that is done in the pure house, as it was done formerly. He was born
5.  in the year 53, second month of the second season (sixth month), day 19, under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt: Wahibre; Son of Re: Psamtik (I), triumphant.
6.  He was [rece]ived into the house of Ptah in the year 54, third month of the first season (third month), day 12. He departed from life
7.  [in the year] 16, second month of the first season (second month), day 6. The total of his length of life was 16 years, 7 months, and 17 days. The majesty of
8.  the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Necho, living forever, made all the coffins and every thing excellent and profitable for this august god.
9.  He built for him his place in the necropolis, of fine limestone of Ayan, of excellent workmanship. Never happened the like
10. since the beginning. That he might be given all life, stability, satisfaction, health, and joy of heart, like Re, forever and ever.

<blockquote>
<p>This would indicate that Psamtik ruled an even number of complete
years, but we cannot suppose that Psamtik I died on the last day of
the year; it is evident that he died in the fifty-fifth year of his
reign, and that the fraction of that incomplete year was, after his
death, included in the first year of his successor, Necho. It is thus
clear that the years of the king's reign in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty
began on New Year's Day.</p>

<p>We can see that Herodotus and the Egyptian Stelae in agreement with the
exception of Apries, although Herodotus is not necessarily incorrect;
Apries did not die in his 20th year, but rather entered into a
co-regency with Amasis, ruling together for at least 3 further years

<ul>
<li>
<p>(23:29) &quot;While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up
to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah
marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed
him at Megiddo&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(23:30) &quot;the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and
anointed him and made him king in place of his father.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(23:31) &quot;Jehoahaz ... reigned in Jerusalem three months&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(23:33) &quot;Pharaoh Necho put him (Jehoahaz) in chains at Riblah in the
land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(23:34) &quot;Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of
his father Josiah and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(23:36) &quot;Jehoiakim ... reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:1) &quot;During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:1) &quot;But then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:2) &quot;The Lord sent Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite and Ammonite
raiders against him to destroy Judah&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:6) &quot;Jehoiakim rested with his ancestors. And Jehoiachin his son
succeeded him as king&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:7) &quot;The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country
again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:8) &quot;Jehoiachin ... reigned in Jerusalem three months.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:10) &quot;At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:11-12) &quot;Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his
officers were besieging it. Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother,
his attendants, his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him.
In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon, he took
Jehoiachin prisoner.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:13) &quot;Nebuchadnezzar removed the treasures from the temple of the
Lord and from the royal palace, and cut up the gold articles that
Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the Lord.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:14) &quot;He carried all Jerusalem into exile: all the officers and
fighting men, and all the skilled workers and artisans—a total of
ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:16) &quot;The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire
force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and fit for war, and a
thousand skilled workers and artisans.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:17) &quot;He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place
and changed his name to Zedekiah.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24:18) &quot;Zedekiah ... reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:1) &quot;in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of
the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against
Jerusalem with his whole army.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:2) &quot;The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of
King Zedekiah.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:3-4) &quot;the ninth day of the fourth month ... the city wall was
broken through&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:8) &quot;the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year
of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan ... an official of
the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:11) &quot;Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile
the people who remained in the city&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:12) &quot;But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of
the land to work the vineyards and fields.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:13-15) &quot;The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable
stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the Lord and
they carried the bronze to Babylon. 14 They also took away the pots,
shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in
the temple service. The commander of the imperial guard took away
the censers and sprinkling bowls—all that were made of pure gold or
silver.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:25) &quot;In the seventh month, ... all the people from the least to
the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for
fear of the Babylonians.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(25:27) &quot;In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king
of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, he
released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. He did this on the
twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.&quot;</p>

<p>At first it would appear that there are significant contradictions, both
internally within the Bible, and when synchronising with the Babylonian
chronicles. Some of the main issues include:</p>
<h2 id="battle-of-carchemish-1"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish-1">Battle of Carchemish</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The 4th year of Jehoiakim = 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah
25:1)</li>
<li>Pharaoh Necho was defeated at Carchemish in the 4th year of
Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 46:2)</li>
<li>(Between month I-V) 21st year of Nabopolassar (= accession year of
Nebuchadnezzar) Egypt was defeated at Carchemish (<a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">Nebuchadnezzar
Chronicle / BM 21946 Obv. 1-10</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Was the 4th year of Jehoiakim (and therefore the battle of Carchemish)
in the accession or 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar?</p>
<h2 id="second-siege-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#second-siege-of-jerusalem">Second Siege of Jerusalem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Jehoiachin taken captive in the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings
24:12)</li>
<li>Nebuchadnezzar took 3023 Jews into exile in his 7th year (Jeremiah
52:28)</li>
<li>Nebuchadnezzar seized the king of Judah on 2/XII of his 7th year
(<a href="judean/../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle / BM 21946 Rev.
11-12</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Was Jehoiachin (and other captives) taken in the 7th or 8th year of
Nebuchadnezzar?</p>
<h2 id="third-siege-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#third-siege-of-jerusalem">Third Siege of Jerusalem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>On 7th (or 10th) day, month V in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuzaradan came to Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:8) (Jeremiah 25:12) and
took Jews into exile.</li>
<li>In the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 people were taken into exile
(Jeremiah 52:29).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Babylonians did not break into the city until the 19th year of
Nebuchadnezzar, then why does Jeremiah only list captives as being taken
in the 18th year (and not the 19th)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In working out the chronology of a nation, a primary requisite is that
the chronological procedure of that nation be understood. The
following items must be definitely established: (1) the year from
which a king began to count the years of his reign—whether from the
time of his actual accession, from the following year, or from some
other time; (2) the time of the calendar year when a king began to
count his reign; (3) the method according to which a scribe of one
nation reckoned the years of a king of a neighboring state, whether
according to the system used in his nation or according to that of the
neighbor; (4) whether or not the nation made use of coregencies,
whether or not several rival rulers might have been reigning at the
same time, and whether interregna occurred; (5) whether during the
period under review a uniform system was followed, or whether
variations took place; and, finally, (6) some absolute date during the
period in question from which the years can be figured backward and
forward so that the full chronological pattern might be secured. An
understanding of each of the above items is necessary to a correct
reconstruction of the chronologies of Israel and Judah, for unless one
is acquainted with the type of chronological procedure in use, a wrong
interpretation is likely to be placed on the available data and cause
an erroneous pattern to ensue. [1, p. 43]</p>

the year was usually called the king's accession year, but not till
the first day of the first month of the next new year did the king
begin reckoning events in his own first year. This system of reckoning
is called the accession year system, or postdating. [1, p. 43]</p>

<p>Whilst we know the Babylonians began their calendar year at Nisanu in
Spring (<a href="judean/../introduction/calendar.html">see Calendar</a>), the situation in
Judah is more complex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the Hebrews there were two calendar years, one beginning with
Nisan in the spring and the other with Tishri in the fall. With which
of these months did the Hebrews begin reckoning their regnal years?
And did both Israel and Judah follow the same practice? [1, p. 44]</p>

<p>No consensus has yet been reached whether the Judean kings regnal years
were reckoned from Nisan or Tishri [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Postulating a Nisan-to-Nisan year in Judah one has, consequently, to
equate the 4th year of Jehoiakim with the accession year of
Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 25:1) rather than with the Babylonian king's
first full year. The <em>hapax eiremenon</em> הראשנית השנה in Jer. 25:1 would
refer therefore to the rēš šarrǔti (= accession year) of
Nebuchadnezzar. [2, p. 227]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding Jehoiakim's 3 year vassalage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The three years of Jehoiakim's submission to Babylon before he
rebelled would be then (Judean years): 604/3-602/1. The revolt in 601
might have been connected with the new ascendency of Egypt, whose new
strength is evident from the defeat inflicted by Necho on the
attacking armies of Babylon in that year. The account of Josephus
(Ant. x, 87) of a new Babylonian campaign to Judah in Jehoiakim's 8th
and Nebuchadnezzar's 4th year and the tribute paid to Babylon accords
with the new Babylonian chronicle, which tells of a submission of
Hatti prior to the battle with Egypt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However no attempt at explaining Daniel 1:1 appears to have been made
(with which it would contradict since it says Nebuchadnezzar seiged
Jerusalem in the 3rd year of Jehoiakim).</p>
<p>Tadmor seems to believe the exiles (and Jehoiachin) were taken from
Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah's accession did not begin until the start
of the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar, despite the fact that according to
<a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM 21946 Rev. 11-13</a>
Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, took vast tribute and appointed a
new king at the end of his 7th year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statements in Jer. 52:28 and 52:29 that 3023 Judeans had been
exiled in the 7th and 18th (instead of the correct 8th and 19th) years
of Nebuchadnezzar seem to derive from the same tradition, but no
satisfactory explanation of its origin has yet been offered. [2, p.
230]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the release of Jehoiachin in the accession year of
Amel-Marduk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually it was four or two days less than 37 full years, so that the
Judean king was released on the eve of the New Year festival, when
Amel-Marduk was to be formally enthroned. [2, p. 230]</p>

<h2 id="discussion-1"><a class="header" href="#discussion-1">Discussion</a></h2>
<p>Concerning the Jeremiah 25:1 issue, Jones agrees with Tadmor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hebrew words for “first year” in Jer. 25:1 are השנה הראשנית
(hashshanah haroshniyth). Not being found elsewhere in Scripture, the
phrase is unique and the feminine singular form of the adjective
modifying the word “year” can mean either “first or beginning”. Thus
the phrase in Jer. 25:1 is seen as not referring to Nebuchadnezzar’s
official first year but to his initial year on the throne, the year of
his accession. [2, p. 125]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones places Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Judah in the 3rd year of
Jehoiakim as per Daniel 1:1. However this would actually precede
Nebuchadnezzar's reign, and fall in the 20th year of Nabopolasssar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It follows then that Daniel 1:1 does not conflict with Jeremiah 25:1
as is often claimed. Observe that Daniel 1:1 does not say that the
third year of the reign of Jehoiakim is the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. As illustrated, such would be impossible from
the data in chapter 1 when compared to 2:1 which is said to occur in
Nebuchadnezzar’s second year of dominion. Moreover, Daniel 1:1 is
merely a statement of identification, i.e., the Nebuchadnezzar who
came and besieged Jerusalem in Jehoiakim’s third year is the same man
who ascended to the throne and became sole rex the following year
(Jer. 25:1). The apparent contradiction has been resolved by simply
allowing the Scriptures to speak for themselves, apart from profane
materials. [2, p. 190]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the deportations at the end of Jeremiah, in the 7th and 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, inconceivably, the later portion of Jeremiah 52 seems to record
the fall of Jerusalem as having taken place in the 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar rather than in his 19th (which was Zedekiah’s 11th). To
begin with, these verses are not recorded in 2 Kings 25. Jeremiah
52:28–34 seems to be an addendum – possibly written by Ezra in Babylon
after Jeremiah’s death (It is noteworthy that it is not part of the
text of the LXX.).<br> Being so small a number, most suppose verses
28–30 are referring to only the adult males of importance. Yet, how
can we conclude that only 4,600 Jews were carried away in all of
Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions when we know at least 10,000 of
prominence were carried away at one time with Jeconiah in 597 BC (2
Kings 24:12–16)?<br> Indeed, the very fact that 2 Kings 24:12–16
records the removal of these 10,000 in the eighth year of
Nebuchadnezzar demands that Jer. 52:28 where 3,023 were said to have
been carried away in that monarch’s seventh year is referring to a
completely separate event. The differing numbers should alert us that
it is not merely a matter of attempting to reconcile Nebuchadnezzar’s
seventh with his eighth year by “Hebrew reckoning” or “Babylonian
reckoning” that is in view here. Two different happenings are before
us.<br> It follows that if these are not equivalent, and thus should
not be associated, then the same is true for trying to force the “18th
year” of Jer. 52:29 to match the “19th year” of Jer. 52:12 and 2 Kings
25:8. Hence, it seems most reasonable to conclude with Ussher that
there were three significant deportations – in 606 BC (when
Nebuchadnezzar was general-of-the-army and crown prince, Dan.1:1), as
well as his 8th, and 19th regnal years — which are to be distinguished
from the minor ones that Jer. 52:28–30 lists in his 7th, 18th, and
23rd years. These latter, then, were likely added after the fact to
complete the historical record.<br> If so, the first minor
deportation, reported by Jeremiah to have transpired in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year, would have been those seized by the bands
of Chaldeans, Syrians, etc. whom the king of Babylon sent against
Judah prior to his coming (2 Kings 24:2). That in the 18th year would
correspond to when the Chaldeans broke off the siege of Jerusalem to
meet Pharaoh’s approaching army. Afterward, it may have been deemed
prudent to march the swelling number of Egyptian and Jewish prisoners
in the camp off to Babylon. [2, p. 127]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="criticism"><a class="header" href="#criticism">Criticism</a></h2>
<p>Against Jones' dating for Daniel 1:1 Ian Foley argues [3]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jones (2004, 189) takes the view that the only possible solution to
this first problem is that Nebuchadnezzar must have besieged Jerusalem
and Daniel must have been exiled in 606 BC. However, this solution
creates as many problems as it solves because (1) Nebuchadnezzar was
not yet king in 606 BC. (However, he was crown prince, and perhaps the
title of &quot;king&quot; could be used), (2) Jones uses nonaccession year
reckoning for the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar so that his second
year is 604 BC, and it is not clear why he did not use accession year
reckoning to make Nebuchadnezzar's second year 603 BC. (3) Until the
defeat of the Egyptians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, there
is strong evidence that Egypt controlled Judah and Palestine and that
Nebuchadnezzar's expeditions prior to that involved conflict with
Egypt in Syria and further north, and (4) there are other solutions to
the two problems that would satisfy Jones's view of biblical
inspiration without the need to propose Daniel's exile in 606 BC.</p>

<h3 id="megiddo"><a class="header" href="#megiddo">Megiddo</a></h3>
<p>According to <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">BM 21901</a> line 66,
the Egyptian army crossed the river Euphrates in Tammuz (IV) of
Nabopolassar's 17th year. Malamat therefore argues that the battle of
Megiddo took place in Sivan (III):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josiah evidently died in Sivan or possibly at the start of Tammuz, as
indicated by correlating the biblical account (2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chron.
35:20-23) with that of the Babylonian Chronicle of Nabopolassar,
father of Nebuchadnezzar. The Bible relates that Necho, when
intercepted by Josiah at Megiddo, was in great haste northward ('for
God commanded me to make haste'; 2 Chron. 35:21), while the Babylonian
source records that 'a large Egyptian army', on its way to aid the
allied Assyrians against the Babylonian forces, had already crossed
the Euphrates in Tammuz. Assuming that the Egyptian army marched at
the considerable rate of 35 km a day, or even more (remembering that
this took place during the long summer days), it could have covered
the distance between Megiddo and Carchemish (over 500 km) in about two
weeks. Thus, the Battle of Megiddo probably occurred sometime between
early Sivan and early Tammuz. [3, p. 139]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But note now that the Egyptians required almost a month, rather than
two weeks, to cover the distance to the river (which they crossed in
Tammuz 609 B.C.), for the actual distance between Megiddo and
Carchemish is about 650 km, and the advance of the rushing Egyptian
army should be estimated at about 25-30 km per diem. [2, p. 125]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the march, and therefore timing of the battle of Megiddo
is significant because it has an impact on the likelihood of a Tishri to
Tishri year in Judah, as explained by Clines [4, p. 29]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In determining the date of his [Jehoiakim's] accession, the events
which must be brought into relationship are: <br>1. Battle of Megiddo,
death of Josiah, accession of Jehoahaz. <br>2. March of Egyptians from
Megiddo to Euphrates. <br>3. Egyptian crossing of Euphrates for attack
on Harran. <br>4. Capture of Jehoahaz and accession of Jehoiakim.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The chronological data are twofold: <br>a. No. 3 occurred in Tammuz
(25 June-23 July), 609 (BM 21901, Rev. 66-67). <br>b. 'Three months'
intervened between No. 1 and No. 4 (2 Kings 23:31; 2 Chr. 36:2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Clines believes it is more likely that Josiah died, Jehoahaz
ruled for 3 months, and then Jehoiakim acceded to the throne before
Tishri 1, rather than after it, and as such this would move his
accession year back by one. If this were the case it would cause a
conflict since Jehoiakim would have died in his 12th rather than 11th
year as described in 2 Kings 23:36 and 2 Chronicles 36:5. [4, p. 32]</p>
<h3 id="carchemish"><a class="header" href="#carchemish">Carchemish</a></h3>
<p>According to <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM 21946</a> Obv. 1-10
the battle of Carchemish took place sometime during the first 4 months
of Nabopolassar's 21st year, in Malamat's chronology this would
correspond to Jehoiakim's 3rd year, rather than his 4th as described in
Jeremiah 46:2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the Babylonian source, see <em>CCK</em>, pp. 66ff. (BM 21946). Jer. 46:2
places the Battle of Carchemish in Jehoiakim's fourth regnal year, the
only substantial instance of a date conflicting with our Tishri
reckoning, which would put this battle in his third year (cf. the
Chronological Table). See <em>IEJ</em> XVIII 1968, p. 147, n. 21, where we
have also cited HORN's suggestion to reconcile the difficulty here by
attributing this date to the time of the oracular utterance rather
than to the battle itself. Although problematic, this might find
support in Jer. 36:1-2, where the date of the Prophet's first scroll,
which recorded <em>inter alia</em> Oracles on the Nations, is fixed in
Jehoiakim's fourth regnal year. The chronological notation at the head
of the Oracles on the Nations in Jer. 46:2 thus may well have been
harmonized with this. WEIPPERT (<em>Edom</em>, p. 653, n. 1238) assumes that
the Battle of Carchemish and the subsequent Babylonian campaign, which
latter took place in the winter of 605/604 B.C., after the
enthronement of Nebuchadnezzar. were regarded in Judah as one
continuous military episode, which thus would have fallen already in
Jehoiakim's fourth regnal year; but Jeremiah's prophecy specifically
deals with the defeat of &quot;the army of Pharaoh Necho&quot; which no longer
took part in events half a year after the Battle of Carchemish. [2,
p. 127]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="subjugation-of-judah"><a class="header" href="#subjugation-of-judah">Subjugation of Judah</a></h3>
<p>Malamat does not offer a definitive date for Nebuchadnezzar's
subjugation of Judah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Babylonian subjugation of Judah was not long in coming. The exact
date is still a matter of controversy, and even Nebuchadnezzar's
Chronicle is indefinite. Military campaigns to the West are recorded
for each of the years between 605 and 601 B.C., but no specific names
of subjected states are mentioned (except Ashkelon). [2, p. 129]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first solution (corresponding to Obv. line 8 of <a href="judean/solutions/../../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a>) is the only one that works
with Jehoiakim's 3rd year as per Daniel 1:1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) Judah was conquered immediately after the Egypdan defeat at the
Battle of Carchemish. This is supported by the opening of the Book of
Daniel (1:1-4) relating the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in
the third year of Jehoiakim (see Chronological Table), the looting of
&quot;vessels of the house of God&quot;, and the exiling of certain Judeans.
Further the last datum is in accord with a tradition related by
Josephus (<em>Ant</em>. X; 11, 1; <em>Contra Apionem</em> I, 19), that Judean
captives; amongst others, were carried off to Babylon after the
victory at Carchemish. In another passage (Ant. X, 6, 1), Josephus
even specifies that at this same time Nebuchadnezzar conquered all the
lands of the West as far as Pelusium on the border of Egypt—but he
explicitely adds: &quot;except the land of Judah&quot;; It is difficult,
however, to rely upon the chronological accuracy of these traditions
(which apparently refer to events occurring several years later).
Though Josephus's data largely agree with those of the Babylonian
Chronicle, the Chronicle itself does not bear out any widespread
conquests in the West while Nebuchadnezzar was still Crown Prince.
Immediately after the victory at Carchemish, as we now know,
Nebuchadnezzar conquered only the &quot;entire land of Ha[ma]th&quot;, and not
the &quot;entire land of Hatti&quot; (that is, Syria-Palestine), as formerly
read.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="issues"><a class="header" href="#issues">Issues</a></h4>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar would not yet be King until later in that year, so Daniel
1:1 would need to be read proleptically [5, p. 183] [4, p. 23].</p>
<p>Clines questions whether there is enough time between the battle of
Carchemish and Nebuchadnezzar's return to Babylon (month VI) following
Nabopolassar's death [5, p. 187]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It involves the interposition of a Babylonian march to Jerusalem from
Hamath (no place further south is mentioned in the Babylonian
Chronicle) and a siege of the city in the short interval between
May-June (Carchemish) and c. August 25 (news of Nabopolassar's death).
Very little time, if any, would be available for the siege itself,
when the days spent in marching are reckoned up (see below, under
II.2). We do not know where Nebuchadrezzar was when he received news
of his father's death, but it must be recalled that only 3 weeks
elapsed between Nabopolassar's death and Nebuchadrazzar's arrival in
Babylon. [4, p. 24]</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h4>
<p>Alternatively Malamat suggests in the 1st year of Nebuchadnezzar (Obv.
15-17) [2, p. 130]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b) Judah submitted a year later, when Nebuchadnezzar devastated
Ashkelon, in Kislev of his first regnal year (December 604 B.C.). This
date corresponds exactly with the ninth month of the fifth regnal year
of Jehoiakim, when a general day of fasting was proclaimed in
Jerusalem (Jer. 36:9 ff.; see the Chronological Table). Jeremiah's
foreboding words, brought before an emergency council of ministers on
the fastday, warned of the impending national calamity— the full drama
of which we can trace today by means of the Babylonian Chronicle. But
Jehoiakim, belittling Jeremiah's warning &quot;that the king of Babylon
will certainly come and destroy this land&quot; (Jer. 36:29), burned the
Prophet's scroll of doom, which leads to the conclusion that Judah at
this time was still not subdued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in his 2nd year (Obv. 21-23)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>c) The submission of Judah may have occurred only in the autumn or
winter of 603 B.C., during Nebuchadnezzar's campaign in his second
regnal year. Unfortunately, the broken state of the Babylonian tablet
here does not enable us to confirm this. In this campaign, which was
certainly to the West, the Babylonian king set out in the month of
Iyyar with a &quot;mighty army&quot; supported by siege machines, indicating
that strong opposition was anticipated. Nebuchadnezzar was most
probably seeking to subdue all Philistia and gain control of Judah—all
as a prelude to his ultimate goal—the conquest of Egypt, his
arch-rival. If this be the case, the lacuna here is to be restored
with the conquest of a specific city in Philistia, such as Ashdod,
Ekron or more probably Gaza (cf. Jer. 25:20; 47:5; Zeph. 2:4); the
subsequent missing section of the tablet might then relate to the
submission of Jehoiakim (cf. II Chron. 36:6-7; Dan. 1:1-2—both
apparently relating to this event).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But these would be in the 5th or 6th year of Jehoiakim, so do not fit
Daniel 1:1, and they also take place after Nebuchadnezzar
<code>marched about victoriously in Hattu</code> in his accession year (Obv. Line
12-14).</p>
<h3 id="seiges-of-jerusalem"><a class="header" href="#seiges-of-jerusalem">Seiges of Jerusalem</a></h3>
<p>Malamat attempts to reconcile the differing dates and numbers of exiles
between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25, by viewing them as separate
events:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biblical sources on the exile of Jehoiachin are in outward
contradiction, in both the extent of the exile and its exact date.
According to II Kings 24, the exile encompassed 10,000 (<em>vs</em>. 14) or
7,000 (<em>vs</em>. 16) persons, mostly military, to either of which we must
add a thousand armourers and sappers. This mass exile, headed by
Jehoiachin and his entourage, occurred according to this source in the
eight year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (<em>vs</em>. 12), the year beginning on
1 Nisan 597 B.C.—at least a month after the surrender of Jerusalem.
Moreover, II Chronicles 34:10 also implies that Jehoiachin was exiled
around the time of the civil new year, and that Nebuchadnezzar had
already returned to his capital, surely for the annual festivities.
But according to the list of exiles in Jeremiah 52 (based undoubtedly
on some official source), a mere 3,023 &quot;Jews&quot; were exiled—in the
<em>seventh</em> year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (<em>vs</em> 28). These have
generally been regarded as contradicting traditions on one and the
same matter, or it has been thought that different chronological
systems were employed in the Book of Kings and in Jeremiah 52,
respectively —though even then the numbers for the deportees disagree.
The discrepancies between the two sources can be reconciled, however,
by proposing that the exile evolved in two successive deportations:
<br> a) The first phase (already intimated in Jer. 13:18-19) was a
limited deportation prior to or upon the surrender of Jerusalem —still
in Nebuchadnezzar's seventh year (Jer. 52:28). The particular
appellative here, &quot;Jews&quot;—implying the provincial element of Judah—is
brought into perspective by the designation &quot;from Jerusalem&quot;, applied
to the exiles deported during the final siege, in Nebuchadnezzar's
18th year (<em>vs</em>. 29; and see the Chronological Table). Several years
after the destruction of Jerusalem, in Nebuchadnezzar's 23rd year, the
deportees are once again, and quite appropriately, called &quot;Jews&quot;
(<em>vs</em>. 30). <br> b) The second, principal phase of the exile,
described in the Book of Kings, comprised the cream of Jerusalem and
thousands of her defenders, including the armourers and sappers
specifically mentioned as exiled from the capital (Jer. 24:1; 29:2).
The organization of this mass exile surely necessitated several weeks
from the time of the surrender of the city, on 2 Adar, and thus it
would have fallen only in Nebuchadnezzar's eighth regnal year, by
which time he had already left the country.</p>
