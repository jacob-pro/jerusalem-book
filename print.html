<p>The aim of this book is to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do historians claim the destruction of Jerusalem took place in
587/586 BC?</li>
<li>Why is there an uncertainty between 587 and 586 BC?</li>
<li>Why do Jehovah's Witnesses claim the destruction of Jerusalem
actually took place in 607 BC?</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="header" href="#about-the-author" id="about-the-author">About the Author</a></h2>
<p>My name is Jacob Halsey, I am a software engineer / computer scientist.
My interest in this topic stems from being encouraged by friends and
family to research the Biblical prophecies of Daniel, and from having
read the &quot;Daniel Book&quot; [1] many years ago. I am not (and have never
been) a baptised member of Jehovah's Witnesses myself.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#significance-to-jehovahs-witnesses" id="significance-to-jehovahs-witnesses">Significance to Jehovah's Witnesses</a></h1>
<p>The date of the destruction of Jerusalem is used as the foundation of a
very important belief to Jehovah’s Witnesses - the &quot;end of the Gentile
Times&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Gentile times&quot; is an interpretation of a prophesy found in Luke
21:24 combined with Daniel chapter 4. These times are believed to be
2520 years long, starting from the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 BC
and ending in 1914 AD [1, p. 215].</p>
<p>According to the Watchtower 1986 [2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approved association with Jehovah’s Witnesses requires accepting the
entire range of the true teachings of the Bible, including those
Scriptural beliefs that are unique to Jehovah’s Witnesses. What do
such beliefs include? ... That 1914 marked the end of the Gentile
Times and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the heavens, as
well as the time for Christ’s foretold presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition the &quot;end of the Gentile Times&quot; in 1914 is also used as a
prerequisite to a number of other interpretations of prophesy in the
&quot;Time of the End&quot; [3, p. 286]:</p>
<p>Daniel 12:7: &quot;a time, times and half a time&quot; is interpreted as a period
of 1260 days running from December 1914 (release of 1915 year text) to
21 June 1918 (the sentencing of J F Rutherford and other directors of
the Watch Tower Society) [4, p. 9].</p>
<p>Daniel 12:11: &quot;1290 days&quot; is counted from the January 1919 (the proposal
of the League of Nations) until September 1922 (Bible student convention
at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A).</p>
<p>Daniel 12:12: &quot;the 1,335 days&quot; is counted from September 1922 (see
above) until May 1926 (adoption of &quot;A Testimony to the Rulers of the
World&quot;, at the London convention).</p>

<p>The Babylonian calendar was made up of 12 lunar months. The year starts
at Nisanu in the Spring; within about 30 days of the vernal equinox [1,
p. 131]. However 12 lunar months are about 11 days short of a year, so
in order to prevent the months from drifting through the seasons, an
intercalary 13th month, either a second Ululu (VI₂) or a second Addaru
(XII₂), was occasionally inserted by decree of the King. Prior to
approx. 475 BC this was done at irregular intervals, a list of known
intercalary months is contained in Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D.
75 [2, p. 4].</p>
<p>The Babylonian day began at sunset. Each month starts &quot;when the thin
crescent of the new moon was first visible in the sky at sunset&quot; [2, p.
1]. The moon becomes visible between about 15 to 48 hours after
conjunction (at Mediterranean latitudes), although first sighting may
also be delayed by weather conditions, but not by more than one day [1,
p. 131].</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#julian-and-gregorian-calendars" id="julian-and-gregorian-calendars">Julian and Gregorian Calendars</a></h2>
<p>The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE [3].
However the primary calendar used today is the Gregorian calendar, named
after Pope Gregory XII who introduced it in October 1582. It is a minor
refinement to the Julian calendar with the aim of bringing the length of
an average year closer to an actual solar year, it does so by modifying
the rules used for choosing leap years.</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar uses the following rule: &quot;Every year that is
exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are
exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if
they are exactly divisible by 400.&quot; the mean length is therefore
365.2425 days. Whereas the Julian calendar has a leap year every 4 years
and therefore has a 365.25 day mean length. The actual solar year is
approx. 365.2422 days.</p>
<p>In addition to changing the leap years, the Gregorian calendar was
offset by a 10 days to restore the date of Easter to the time which it
would have been celebrated by early church. In the 20th and 21st century
the Julian calendar would be about 13 days ahead of the Gregorian
calendar. Note that whilst the Gregorian calendar was quickly adopted in
Roman Catholic Europe, it took some time before the rest of the world
followed. It was adopted in Great Britain in 1752 and was not adopted in
most of Eastern Europe until the early 20th century.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar" id="mapping-babylonian-dates-to-the-julian-calendar">Mapping Babylonian dates to the Julian calendar</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of astronomy and historical dating it is standard
practice to use the Julian calendar when dealing with dates prior to 15
October 1582, and the Gregorian calendar for later dates. All calendar
dates that are used in this book when discussing the Neo-Babylonian era
will therefore be using the Julian calendar.</p>
<p>Also note that the year 0 BC / AD did not exist - rather the years
progress from 1 BC directly to 1 AD. Therefore when using negative years
there will be a 1 year difference; for example the year -100 is the same
year as 101 BC.</p>

<p>This chapter will look at some of the sources from which historians can
determine the chronology of the Neo-Babylonian period.</p>
<p>By doing so I will indirectly answer the first question (why historians
claim the destruction took place in 586/587 BC) by showing the dates for
the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II.</p>

<p>Museum number IM 65066 (Iraq Museum), also known as King List 5 [1, p.
97].</p>
<p>The list is a fragment of a tablet, the obverse covers the reigns from
Kandalanu to Darius I. The reverse spans from Darius III to Seleucus II,
and was therefore inscribed sometime after his reign (226 BC).</p>
<p>Origin: Excavated in winter 1959/60 at Uruk-Warka (W 20030, 10j).</p>

<p>Concerning the early chronicles Grayson says [1, p. 14]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion it may be stated that Chronicles 1-7 represent only a
small part of a series of late Babylonian chronicles which, like all
chronicles of category A, were probably resumes or extracts made from
running accounts which were sometimes kept on writing-boards and these
running accounts were probably identical with astronomical diaries.
The narrative exhibits a narrow outlook restricted to matter of
concern to Babylonia, but within these confines the authors are
objective. Their main concern is to record what actually happened.
Thus one may use these documents as source material for the history of
the period with considerable confidence in their reliability.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#business-tablets" id="business-tablets">Business Tablets</a></h1>
<p>The majority of recovered cuneiform texts were written for
administrative, legal, and economic purposes. By looking at the dates
that they contain, combined with other data such as the city they were
from, can show us useful chronological information.</p>
<p>For example the dates have been used in the following publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [1, p. 10]</li>
<li>A Survey of Dated Babylonian Economic Texts, 721-626 B.C. [2]
[3]</li>
<li>Part II: A Survey of Babylonian Texts, 626-605 B.C. [4]</li>
</ul>
<p>A more complete survey has been published by J Everling [5],
originally available
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030207180625/http://www.nexus.hu:80/enkidu/enkidu.html">here</a>
in text format. From the survey I have generated bar charts counting the
tablets dated to each year of each King's reign.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#shamash-shum-ukin" id="shamash-shum-ukin">Shamash-shum-ukin</a></h3>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Shamash-shum-ukin.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>V/28/20 - Borsippa, BM 134973 [6] (K.142 [2, p. 36])</li>
<li>V/30/20 - Babylon, BM 40577 [7] (K.143 [2, p. 36])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#kandalanu" id="kandalanu">Kandalanu</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>X/6/1 - Babylon, VAT 2963 (L.1 [2, p. 39])</li>
<li>XII/10/1 - Sippar?, BM 49326 [8] (L.2 [2, p. 39])</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Kandalanu.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>II/25/21 - Borsippa, BM 26377 [9] (L.158a [3, p. 103])</li>
<li>III/8/21 - Sippar?, BM 50270 [10] (L.159 [2, p. 49])</li>
<li>VIII/?/21 - Babylon, BM 36514 [11] <strong>&quot;After Kandalanu&quot;</strong> [12, p.
91]</li>
<li>VIII/2/22 - Babylon, BM 40039 [13] <strong>&quot;After Kandalanu&quot;</strong> [12, p.
91]</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Kandalanu died somewhere between month
III and VIII of his 21st year, and that during the 22nd year there was
no other king in Babylon.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nabopolassar" id="nabopolassar">Nabopolassar</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>II/13?/Acc - ?, NCBT 557 [14]</li>
<li>VI/22/Acc - Sippar? BM 49656 [15]</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Wiseman: [12, p. 93]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chronicle (B.M. 25127, 11. I4-I5) expressly states that
Nabopolassar sat on the throne of Babylon on the 26th of Marcheswan
[VIII] ... Unless a scribal error is assumed it would seem,
therefore, that Nabopolassar was acknowledged king at least at Sippar
which had become independent of Assyria before the final battle at
Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Nabopolassar.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>V/1/21 - KUR.A.DAN.ŠU, A5302 [1, p. 12]</li>
<li>V/20/21 - ?, PTS 2761 (T.21.14 [4])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Nabopolassar ruled for 21 years.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nebuchadnezzar-ii" id="nebuchadnezzar-ii">Nebuchadnezzar II</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>VI/12/Acc - Uruk?, (YOS 17, 153 [16])</li>
<li>VI/18/Acc - Sippar, BM 49524 [17] [12, p. 84]</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Nebuchadnezzar%20II.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>VI/21/43 - Uruk, NCBT 286 [14, p. 44]</li>
<li>VI/26/43 - Uruk, AO 06847 (TCL 12, 58 [18])</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Nebuchadnezzar II ruled for 43 years.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#amel-marduk" id="amel-marduk">Amel-Marduk</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>V/?/Acc - Sippar, BM 58872 [19]</li>
<li>V/20/Acc - Sippar, BM 75322 [20]</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these texts would overlap with the dates for Nebuchadnezzar II
by one month. R H Sack &quot;proposes that Nebuchadrezzar bought his son into
a co-regency before his death&quot;, which D J Wiseman agrees &quot;is certainly
possible&quot; [21, p. 451].</p>
<p>However D B Weisberg disagrees [22, p. 68]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a possible co-regency of Nebuchadnezzar and Amēl-Marduk does not seem
conclusive. ... The dates we have for the end of one rule and the
beginning of another must be used with an understanding of the human
factors that led to their recording. An Uruk scribe still dating texts
to the reign of a deceased king (Nebuchadnezzar) might not have known
what was happening at the court. A Sippar scribe dating texts to
Amēl-Marduk might have picked up the news more quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Amel-Marduk.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>V/17/2 - Babylon? (BE 8/1, 34. [23, p. 76])</li>
<li>X/19/2 - Sippar, BM 61325 [24] (Cat.BM 7 [25, p. 36])</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the last date (month X) is an anomaly since of 23 texts from
Amel-Marduks second year it is the only one dated later than month V.</p>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Amel-Marduk ruled for 2 years.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#neriglissar" id="neriglissar">Neriglissar</a></h3>
<p>Earliest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>II/4/Acc - Sippar, BM 75489 [26]</li>
<li>V/21/Acc - Babylon, YBC 3765 [27, p. 67]</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the first date (month II) is an anomaly since of 40 texts from
Neriglissar's accession year it is the only one dated prior to month V;
it is possibly a mistake [28, p. 228].</p>
<p><img src="orthodox/business/charts/Neriglissar.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Latest dated texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I/2/4 - Shahrinu, BM 41401 [29]</li>
<li>I/6/4 - Uruk, YBC 3433 [14, p. 44]</li>

<li>III/11/Acc - Uruk, YBC 3817 [14, p. 44]</li>
</ul>
<p>The tablets therefore show that Labashi-Marduk only ruled for part of
his accession year.</p>

<p>Since there are thousands of dateable texts in the survey it is not
surprising that there will have been some errors in the process of
copying, translating, and collating the texts.</p>

<pre><code>   Col. I.
1.  I (am) the lady Adda-guppi' mother
2.  of Nabium-na'id, king of Babylon,
3.  votaress of the gods Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
4.  and Sadarnunna, my deities ;
5.  who, from my childhood, have sought after
6.  their godheads. Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar,
7.  king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city
8.  and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and
9.  the people that (were) in it went to ruin.
10. (Now) forasmuch as the shrines of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku,
11. and Sadarnunna I sought after and was worshipper of their godhead,
12. (and) that I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
13. I had ever in mind his great godhead—daily, without ceasing,
14. of Sin, Šamaš, Ištar, and Adda, so long as I am alive,
15. I (am) their votaress (both) in heaven and earth. My blessings,
16. the goodly things which they gave me, I (too) by day, night, month, and year, gave (back) to them.
17. I laid hold on the hem of the robe of Sin, king of the gods, night and daytime
18. my two eyes were with him, in prayer and humility of face
19. was I bowed before them (and) thus (I prayed), &quot;May thy return
20. to thy city be (vouchsafed) to me, that the people, the black-headed,
21. may worship thy great godhead.&quot; For calming
22. the heart of my god and my goddess, a dress of fine wool, jewels,
23. silver, gold, a new shift, perfumes, sweet oil,
24. I applied not to my body, (but in) a torn shift
25. I went clothed, my goings-out were noiseless, I proclaimed
26. their praises : the glory of my city and of my goddess
27. was (ever) set in my heart, I kept watch upon them,
28. anything good of mine I did not omit, but carried it (ever) before them.
29. From the 20th year of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, that I was born (in)
30. until the 42nd year of Aššurbanipal, the 3rd year of Aššur-etillu-ili,
31. his son, the 21st year of Nabopolassar, the 43rd year of Nebuchadrezzar,
32. the 2nd year of Awēl-Marduk, the 4th year of Neriglissar,
33. in 95 years of the god Sin, king of the gods of heaven and earth,
34. (in) which I sought after the shrines of his great godhead,
35. (for) my good doings he looked upon me with a smile
36. he heard my prayers, he granted my saying, the wrath
37. of his heart calmed. Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin
38. which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had
39. regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and
40. Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship
41. he called, and the kingship of Sumer and Akkad
42. from the border of Egypt (on) the upper sea even to the lower sea
43. all the lands he entrusted hither
44. to his hands. My two hands I lifted up and to Sin, king of the gods,
45. reverently with imploration [(I prayed) thus, &quot;Nabu-na'id
46. (my) son, offspring of my womb, beloved of his mother,]
   Col. II.
1.  thou hast called him to the kingship, thou hast pronounced his name,
2.  at the command of thy great godhead may the great gods
3.  go at his two sides, may they make his enemies to fall,
4.  forget not, (but) make good E-h̬ul-h̬ul and the finishing of its foundation(?)&quot;.
5.  When in my dream, his two hands had been laid on, Sin, king of the gods,
6, 7. Spoke to me thus, &quot; With thee I will put into the hands of Nabuna'id, thy son, the return of the gods and the habitation of Harran;
8.  He shall build E-h̬ul-h̬ul, shall perfect its structure, (and) Harran
9.  more than (it was) before he shall perfect and restore it to its place.
10. The hand of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna
11. he shall clasp and cause them to enter E-hul-bul &quot;. The word of Sin,
12. king of the gods, which he spoke to me I honoured, and I myself saw (it fulfilled) ;
13. Nabu-na'id, (my) only son, offspring of my womb, the rites
14. forgotten of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and
15. Sadarnunna he perfected, E-h̬ul-h̬ul
16. anew he built and perfected its structure, Harran more
17. than before he perfected and restored it to its place ; the hand
18. of Sin, Nin-gal, Nusku, and Sadarnunna from
19. Šuanna his royal city he clasped, and in the midst of Harran
20. in E-h̬ul-h̬ul the abode of their hearts' ease with gladness
21. and rejoicing he let them dwell. What from former times Sin, king of the gods,
22. had not done and had not granted to anybody (he did) for the love of me
23. who had ever worshipped his godhead, laid hold on the hem of his robe—Sin, king of the gods,
24. uplifted my head and set upon me a good name in the land,
25. long days, years of heart's ease he multiplied upon me.
26. From the time of Aššurbanipal, king of Assyria, until the 9th year
27. of Nabu-na'id king of Babylon, the son, offspring of my womb
28. 104 years of happiness, with the reverence which Sin, king of the gods,
29. placed in me, he made me flourish, my own self: the sight of my two eyes
30. is clear, I am excellent in understanding, my hand and both feet are sound,
31. well-chosen are my words, meat and drink
32. agree with me, my flesh is goodly, glad is my heart.
33. My descendents to four generations from me flourishing in themselves
34. I have seen, I am fulfilled (with) offspring. O Sin, king of the gods, for favour
35. thou hast looked upon me, thou hast lengthened my days: Nabuna'id, king of Babylon,
36. my son, to Sin my lord I have devoted him. So long as he is alive
37. let him not offend against thee; the genius of favour, genius of favour which (to be) with me
38. thou hast appointed and they have caused me to attain offspring, with him (too)
39. appoint (them), and wickedness and offence against thy great godhead
40. endure not, (but) let him worship thy great godhead. In the 21 years
41. of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, in the 43 years of Nebuchadrezzar,
42. son of Nabopolassar,a nd 4 years of Neriglissar, king of Babylon,
43. (when) they exercised the kingship, for 68 years
44. with all my heart I reverenced them, I kept watch over them,
45. Nabu-na'id (my) son, offspring of my womb, before Nebuchadrezzar
46. son of Nabopolassar and (before) Neriglissar, king of Babylon, I caused him to stand,
47. daytime and night he kept watch over them
48. what was pleasing to them he performed continually,
49. my name he made (to be) favourite in their sight, (and) like
50. [a daughtero of] their [own] they uplifted my head
   Col. III.
1.  I nourished (their spirits), and incense offering
2.  rich, of sweet savour,
3.  I appointed for them continually and
4.  laid ever before them.
5.  (Now) in the 9th year of Nabu-na'id,
6.  king of Babylon, the fate
7.  of herself carried her off, and

<h2><a class="header" href="#notes-1" id="notes-1">Notes</a></h2>
<p>There is some uncertainty about the accuracy or interpretation of the
reigns given for the Assyrian kings Ashurbanipal and Ashur-etil-ilani.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Ashur-etil-ilani's reign coincided with the last
4 years of Ashurbanipal [4, p. 138] [5, p. 57], however this would
mean that the total lengths of 95/104 years would be incorrect due to
double counting. Others disagree and believe the inscription does not
contain any error [6].</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is limited evidence to be completely certain about
the chronology of the last Assyrian kings [7, p. 220].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[As to the temples of the gods] whose storehouses [were empty?]
and where they had not established their residence [since.....],
Marduk, my lord, waited for me and entrusted me with the restoration
of the divine cults. He decreed by his pure utterance the appeasement
of the angry gods and my (re)establishment of their dwellings (as a
duty) for my rule. (Concerning) H̬arran (and) the Eh̬ulh̬ul, which had
been lying in ruins for 54 years because of its devastation by the
Medes (who) destroyed the sanctuaries, with the consent of the gods
the time for the reconciliation approached, 54 years, when Sîn should
return to his place. When he returned to his place, Sîn, the lord of
the tiara, remembered his lofty seat, and (as to) all the gods who
left his chapel with him, it is Marduk, the king of the gods, who
ordered their gathering.</p>

<code>Whereas in the 16th year of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, Sin, king of the gods, with his city and his temple was angry and went up to heaven—the city and the people that (were) in it went to ruin.</code></p>
<p><a href="orthodox/chronicles/bm21901.html">Fall of Nineveh Chronicle</a> Lines 58, 63-64:
<code>The sixteenth year: ... The king of Akkad reached Harran and [...] he captured the city. He carried off the vast booty of the city and the temple.</code></p>
<p>Later the <a href="orthodox/nabon24.html">Adad Guppi Stele</a> Col i Lines 37-40 says:
<code>Towards E-h̬ul-h̬ul the temple of Sin which (is) in Harran, the abode of his heart's delight, he was reconciled, he had regard. Sin, king of the gods, looked upon me and Nabu-na'id (my) only son, the issue of my womb, to the kingship</code>.</p>
<p>According to Tadmor the inscription therefore counts 54 years from the
16th year of Nabopolassar to the accession of Nabonidus [1, p. 355]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 54 years are counted from 610, the sixteenth year of Nabopalassar
(when Sin &quot;was angry with his city and his house and went up to
heaven&quot;), to 556, the accession year of Nabunaid. The special
importance attached to the period of 54 years should not be
surprising; it represents, as Professor A. Sachs kindly informs me,
the complete cycle of the moon (i.e., three 18 year cycles).
Accordingly, &quot;Sin's returning to his place&quot; would mean that the moon
cycle was completed. I believe that this coincidence — Nabunaid's
coming to the throne exactly 54 years after the destruction of Harran
— was interpreted as a most favorable omen, that the moon-god had
become reconciled.</p>

death, included in the first year of his successor, Necho. It is thus
clear that the years of the king's reign in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty

<p>There are a number of texts that describe various astronomical events,
such as positions of the moon, stars, planets, lunar eclipses etc, which
allow us to date the reigns of the Babylonian Kings.</p>
<p>This is in itself a very complicated topic and as such I have created a
separate project to analyse them: <a href="https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets">Astro
Tablets</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm32312.md">BM

dates the 16th year of Shamash-shum-ukin to -651.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jacob-pro/astro-tablets/blob/master/documents/bm41222.md">BM
41222</a>
contains dates from many different kings, and conclusively matches the
14th year of Shamash-shum-ukin to -653, 1st year of Kandalanu to -646
and 7th year of Nabopolassar to -618 (if we assume that
Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years and Kandalanu 22 years).</p>
