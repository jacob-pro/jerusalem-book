<p>As listed in the <a href="solutions/watchtower.html">Watchtower Judean Chronology</a>
table the Watchtower dates the Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Judah as
described in 2 Kings 24:1 to sometime in the 8th year of Jehoiakim.</p>
<p>Unusually however the Watchtower then chooses to interpret the siege of
Jerusalem described in Daniel 1:1 and 2 Chronicles 36:6 as referring to
the later siege resulting in Jehoiachin's capture (2 Kings 24:10, which
was the 11th year of Jehoiakim), rather than the earlier invasion
resulting in Jehoiakim becoming a vassal for 3 years (2 Kings 24:1).</p>
<h3 id="insight-book"><a class="header" href="#insight-book">Insight Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Second Kings 24:1 shows that Nebuchadnezzar brought pressure upon the
Judean king “and so Jehoiakim became his servant [or vassal] for
three years. However, he [Jehoiakim] turned back and rebelled
against him [Nebuchadnezzar].” Evidently it is to this third year of
Jehoiakim as a vassal king under Babylon that Daniel refers at Daniel
1:1. It could not be Jehoiakim’s third year of his 11-year reign over
Judah, for at that time Jehoiakim was a vassal, not to Babylon, but to
Egypt’s Pharaoh Necho. It was not until Jehoiakim’s fourth year of
rule over Judah that Nebuchadnezzar demolished Egyptian domination
over Syria-Palestine by his victory at Carchemish (625 B.C.E.
[apparently after Nisan]). (Jer 46:2) Since Jehoiakim’s revolt
against Babylon led to his downfall after about 11 years on the
throne, the beginning of his three-year vassalage to Babylon must have
begun toward the end of his eighth year of rule, or early in 620
B.C.E.<br><br> Daniel’s account (1:1, 2) states that Nebuchadnezzar
came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and that Jehoiakim, along
with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s
hand. However, the account at 2 Kings 24:10-15 describes the siege of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son
Jehoiachin, whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the
one who finally capitulated and went out to the Babylonians. It
therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city,
perhaps in the early part thereof. Jehovah’s prophecy through Jeremiah
(22:18, 19; 36:30) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a
decent burial; his corpse was to lie unattended outside the gates of
Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by night.
Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’
(Da 1:2) is not revealed. It may have been in the sense of his dying
under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into
captivity, so that Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship
at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish
tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim
and commanded that his dead body be thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls.
(Jewish Antiquities, X, 97 [vi, 3]) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s
death came, it appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had
brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.—2Ch 36:6.

<blockquote>
<p>Very little is known of his early life, but he [Daniel] tells of
being taken to Babylon, likely as a teenage prince, along with other
royal offspring and nobles. (Da 1:3-6) This was in Jehoiakim’s third
year (as tributary king to Babylon), which third year started in the
spring of 618 B.C.E. (Da 1:1) With Jehoiakim’s inglorious death,
Jehoiachin, his son, ruled for a few months before surrendering. Early
in 617 B.C.E., Jehoiachin and other “foremost men,” also young Daniel
(2Ki 24:15), were taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. [1, p.
576]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the age of 18 Jehoiachin became king and continued the bad
practices of his father. (2Ki 24:8, 9; 2Ch 36:9, ftn) Jehoiachin’s
father, Jehoiakim, had been under subjection to Babylonian King
Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled in his third year of such vassalage (618
B.C.E.). (2Ki 24:1) This resulted in a siege being laid against
Jerusalem. The expression “during that time” (2Ki 24:10) may refer,
not to Jehoiachin’s brief reign, but to the general period in which it
fits, hence allowing for the siege to have begun during his father
Jehoiakim’s reign, as Daniel 1:1, 2 seems to indicate. It appears that
Jehoiakim died during this siege and Jehoiachin ascended the throne of
Judah. His rule ended, however, a mere three months and ten days
later, when he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E. (in the
month of Adar, according to a Babylonian chronicle). (2Ki 24:11, 12;
2Ch 36:9; Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, by A. Grayson, 1975, p.
102) In fulfillment of Jehovah’s word through Jeremiah, he was taken
into Babylonian exile. (Jer 22:24-27; 24:1; 27:19, 20; 29:1, 2) Other
members of the royal household, court officials, craftsmen, and
warriors were also exiled.—2Ki 24:14-16; [1, p. 1267]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="daniel-book"><a class="header" href="#daniel-book">Daniel Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel 1:1 reads: “In the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the
king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
and proceeded to lay siege to it.” Critics have found fault with this
scripture because it does not seem to agree with Jeremiah, who says
that the fourth year of Jehoiakim was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar. (Jeremiah 25:1; 46:2) Was Daniel contradicting
Jeremiah? With more information, the matter is readily clarified. When
first made king in 628 B.C.E. by Pharaoh Necho, Jehoiakim became a
mere puppet of that Egyptian ruler. This was about three years before
Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father to the throne of Babylon, in 624
B.C.E. Soon thereafter (in 620 B.C.E.), Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah
and made Jehoiakim a vassal king under Babylon. (2 Kings 23:34; 24:1)
To a Jew living in Babylon, Jehoiakim’s “third year” would have been
the third year of that king’s vassal service to Babylon. Daniel wrote
from that perspective. Jeremiah, however, wrote from the perspective
of the Jews living right in Jerusalem. So he referred to Jehoiakim’s
kingship as starting when Pharaoh Necho made him king. [2, p. 18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 625 B.C.E., Egyptian Pharaoh Necho... led his army to Carchemish...
The Babylonian army, led by Crown Prince Nebuchadnezzar, inflicted a
devastating blow on Pharaoh Necho’s forces. (Jeremiah 46:2) Riding on
the momentum of his victory, Nebuchadnezzar swept over Syria and
Palestine and, for all practical purposes, put an end to Egyptian
domination in this region. It was only the death of his father,
Nabopolassar, that brought a temporary halt to his campaign.<br><br>
The next year, Nebuchadnezzar—now enthroned as king of Babylon—once
again turned his attention to his military campaigns in Syria and
Palestine. It was during this period that he came to Jerusalem for the
first time. The Bible reports: “In his days Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon came up, and so Jehoiakim became his servant for three years.
However, he turned back and rebelled against him.”—2 Kings 24:1. [2,
p. 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="let-your-kingdom-come"><a class="header" href="#let-your-kingdom-come">Let Your Kingdom Come</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Later writers quote Berossus as saying that after the battle of
Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar extended Babylonian influence into all
Syria-Palestine and, when returning to Babylon (in his accession year,
605 B.C.E.), he took Jewish captives into exile. Thus they figure the
70 years as a period of servitude to Babylon beginning in 605 B.C.E.
That would mean that the 70-year period would expire in 535
B.C.E.<br><br> But there are a number of major problems with this
interpretation:<br><br> Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar
took Jewish captives in his accession year, there are no cuneiform
documents supporting this. More significantly, Jeremiah 52:28-30
carefully reports that Nebuchadnezzar took Jews captive in his seventh
year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his accession year. Also,
Jewish historian Josephus states that in the year of the battle of
Carchemish Nebuchadnezzar conquered all of Syria-Palestine “excepting
Judea,” thus contradicting Berossus and conflicting with the claim
that 70 years of Jewish servitude began in Nebuchadnezzar’s accession
year.—Antiquities of the Jews X, vi, 1. [3, p. 188]</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-interpretation"><a class="header" href="#history-of-the-interpretation">History of the Interpretation</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind interpreting Daniel 1:1 Jehoiakim as actually referring
to the siege described in 2 Kings 24:10 may have originated with
first-century historian Josephus, who dates the beginning of Jehoiakim's
servitude to his 8th year:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>NOW in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, one whose name
was Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians, who at
the same time went up with a great army to the city Carchemish, which
was at Euphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco
king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. And when Neco understood
the intention of the king of Babylon, and that this expedition was
made against him, he did not despise his attempt, but made haste with
a great band of men to Euphrates to defend himself from
Nebuchadnezzar; and when they had joined battle, he was beaten, and
lost many ten thousands [of his soldiers] in the battle. So the king
of Babylon passed over Euphrates, and took all Syria, as far as
Pelusium, excepting Judea. But when Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned
four years, which was the eighth of Jehoiakim's government over the
Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces
against the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim, and threatened
upon his refusal to make war against him. He was aftrighted at his
threatening, and bought his peace with money, and brought the tribute
he was ordered to bring for three years. <br><br> 2. But on the third
year, upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians made an expedition
against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute; yet was he
disappointed of his hope, for the Egyptians durst not fight at this
time... <br><br> 3. Now, a little time afterwards, the king of Babylon
made an expedition against Jehoiakim, whom he received [into the
city], and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of this
prophet, as supposing he should suffer nothing that was terrible,
because he neither shut the gates, nor fought against him; yet when he
was come into the city, he did not observe the covenants he had made,
but he slew such as were in the flower of their age, and such as were
of the greatest dignity, together with their king Jehoiakim, whom he
commanded to be thrown before the walls, without any burial; and made
his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the city: he also took
the principal persons in dignity for captives, three thousand in
number, and led them away to Babylon; among which was the prophet
Ezekiel, who was then but young. And this was the end of king
Jehoiakim, when he had lived thirty-six years, and of them reigned
eleven. But Jehoiachin succeeded him in the kingdom, whose mother's
name was Nehushta; she was a citizen of Jerusalem. He reigned three
months and ten days. 1. BUT a terror seized on the king of Babylon,
who had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin, and that immediately; he was
afraid that he should bear him a grudge, because of his killing his
father, and thereupon should make the country revolt from him;
wherefore he sent an army, and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem; but
because he was of a gentle and just disposition, he did not desire to
see the city endangered on his account, but he took his mother and
kindred, and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of
Babylon... [4]</li>

<p>The earliest reference I could find in the Watchtower index for Daniel
1:1 was the 1946 <em>Equipped for Every Good Work</em>; published a decade
before the translation of the Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle <a href="../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Daniel 1:1, 2 fixes the start of this first captivity in the
&quot;third year&quot; of Jehoiakim, who started to reign in Judah in 628 B.C.
Would not this mean the captivity of Daniel and others started in 626
B.C., Jehoiakim's third year as king of Judah? No, this could not be,
because Nebuchadnezzar was not enthroned till the following year, 625
B.C. Actually, the opening verse of Daniel means that in &quot;the third
year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah&quot; <em>as a tributary king of
Babylon</em> &quot;came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and
besieged it&quot;. How so? Because Jehoiakim was put on the throne by
Egyptian decree and was tributary to Egypt for several years, but when
Babylon defeated Egypt Jehoiakim came under Babylonian control and so
remained for three years, after which three year period as tributary
to Babylon the Judean king rebelled. (2 Ki. 24:1) That third year as
tributary king to Nebuchadnezzar was the eleventh and last of his
total kingship, because the Babylonian monarch came against the
rebellious Jewish king and quickly completed the conquest during the
three-month reign of Jehoiakim's successor Jehoiachin. Hence 618 B.C.
was the time of the first captivity and the starting point of history
in the book of Daniel. [5, p. 225]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then regarding Daniel 2:1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time of this dream and its interpretation is stated as the second
year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Actually, Nebuchadnezzar had been
reigning over Babylon alone much longer than two years. Why, at the
time of this dream the young captive Daniel had completed his three
years of special court training and had been introduced to
Nebuchadnezzar and had gained quite a reputation for wisdom,
particularly in dreams and visions. In the nineteenth year of his
reign Nebuchadnezzar was used as God's executioner to destroy
faithless Jerusalem and end Israel's history as an independent
Theocratic nation. Then Nebuchadnezzar began reigning in a unique way,
as the first of the world rulers of the Gentile times. In the second
year of his reign in this special capacity the dream showing the end
of Satan's organization and rule and the taking over of power by
Christ's kingdom came to Nebuchadnezzar, as recorded at chapter 2 .
Here again, as at Daniel 1:1, the peculiarity which the writer of this
book has of making a secondary reckoning of the years of a king's
reign is demonstrated. He reckons by counting from epochal events
within the reign that put the king in a new relationship. [5, p.
226]</p>

<h3 id="kingship-daniel-11-and-daniel-21"><a class="header" href="#kingship-daniel-11-and-daniel-21">&quot;Kingship&quot;, Daniel 1:1 and Daniel 2:1</a></h3>
<p>First of all the Watchtower Society is reading Daniel 1:1 in a strange
way - where &quot;kingship&quot; is understood to refer not to the length of
Jehoiakim's rule over Judah, but to his time as a vassal to
Nebuchadnezzar. Against this Mercer argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several commentators take the third year of Jehoiakim as being the
last of the three years of servitude to Babylon mentioned in 2 Kgs
24:1. This solution is unlikely, for the text of Daniel states that
Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem &quot;in the third year of the reign of
Jehoiakim&quot; (bšnṯ šlwš lmlḵwṯ), not &quot;in the third year of the servitude
of Jehoiakim&quot; (bšnṯ šlwš lᶜḇwḏh)—as one might expect if the statement
in Dan 1:1 were derived from 2 Kgs 24:1. [6, p. 180]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This causes an even more substantial problem in that in Daniel 2:1,
Daniel speaks with Nebuchadnezzar during &quot;the second year of his
kingship&quot; - which would be impossible if Daniel was taken captive
sometime around the 7th or 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar. This forces the
Watchtower to use another different interpretation for the meaning of
&quot;kingship&quot; in Daniel 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book of Daniel states that it was in “the second year” of
Nebuchadnezzar’s kingship (probably counting from the destruction of
Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. and therefore actually referring to his 20th
regnal year) that Nebuchadnezzar had the dream about the golden-headed
image. [7, p. 481] also [1, p. 576] [1, p. 1186] [8, p. 18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He had effectively become world ruler in 607 B.C.E. when Jehovah God
allowed him to destroy Jerusalem and its temple. In the second year of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign as world ruler (606/605 B.C.E.), God sent him a
terrifying dream. [2, p. 46]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In favour of an alternative interpretations of &quot;kingship&quot; Foley says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In understanding the first problem, it may be important that the
Hebrew word translated reign in Daniel 1:1 (NIV) is malchut which
appears to be a less specific term for the years of reign than regnal
years, since its use conveys the thought of “kingship” or “sovereign
power”... It is often used without a specific length of time, (e.g.,
Ezra 4:5– 6, Nehemiah 12:22, Jeremiah 49:34) or used in a different
way, as in 2 Chronicles 15:10, where the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign
(kingship) is probably dated from his birth rather than from his
accession year. Thus Daniel 1:1 could be translated “in the third year
of the kingship of Jehoiakim” and could reflect a less precise
reckoning that ignores the month to month differences and sees his
reign beginning in 608 BC and the current year being 605 BC, a
difference of three years. This approach may also help us to
understand the second problem, since it should be noted that the
Hebrew word for reign in Daniel 2:1 is also malchut , so 603 BC must
be the second year of Nebuchadnezzar. [9, p. 33]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However Foley still believes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it would seem most likely that Daniel was taken from Jerusalem late in
605 BC for the purpose of being trained in Babylonian ways. He
completed this training very successfully, probably in 602 BC [9, p.
34]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="death-of-jehoiakim"><a class="header" href="#death-of-jehoiakim">Death of Jehoiakim</a></h3>
<p>As acknowledged in the Insight book [7, p. 480], <a href="../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> states that
<code>In the month Kislev [IX] the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu</code>,
and then that
<code>on the second day of the month Adar [XII] he captured the city (and) seized (its) king.</code></p>
<p>According to 2 Chronicles 36:9 and 2 Kings 24:8, Jehoiachin reigned in
Jerusalem for 3 months and 10 days, subtracting this from the end of his
rule on 2/XII, his rule must have began (and Jehoiakim must have died)
around the end of month VIII, which would be before Nebuchadnezzar
marched to Jerusalem. [10, p. 278]</p>
<p>How can Daniel 1:2 where &quot;Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his
hand&quot; (NWT) and 2 Chronicles 36:6 where &quot;Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against him [Jehoiakim] in order to bind him with two copper
fetters to take him off to Babylon&quot; (NWT) make sense in this context
given that Jehoiakim had already died before Nebuchadnezzar marched
against the city?</p>
<p>According to Clines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some kind of an attack upon Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim is
demanded by the evidence of 2 Chr. 36:6f., which recounts that
Nebuchadrezzar took Jehoiakim in fetters to BabyIon, and also carried
off some of the temple vessels. This cannot have happened at the time
of the siege of Jerusalem in early 597 B.C., since Jehoiakim died on
December 7, 598, just before the Babylonian troops set out for
Jerusalem. So if the Biblical Chronicles tradition is sound, it is
reasonable to suppose that at some time during his reign 'Jehoiakim
took part of the temple treasure [to Babylon] as a <em>qatrē</em>-offering
or as <em>biltu</em> ('tribute') to buy off the Babylonians'. 2 Kings 24:1,
'Nebuchadnezzar came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three
years', may in turn be related to the same circumstances. [11, p.
21]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast the siege in the first year of Jehoiachin in 2 Kings 24 is
described in an order consistent with the Babylonian account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6</strong> Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers...<br>
<strong>8</strong> Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned
for three months in Jerusalem... <strong>9</strong> He continued to do what was bad
in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that his father had done. <strong>10</strong>
During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. (2 Kings
24:6,8-10, NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="marauder-bands"><a class="header" href="#marauder-bands">Marauder Bands</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong> In Jehoiakim’s days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against
him, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. However, he
turned against him and rebelled. <strong>2</strong> Then Jehovah began to send
against him marauder bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and
Ammonites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it...<br>
<strong>6</strong> Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son
Jehoiachin became king in his place. (2 Kings 24:1,2,6,10 NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Watchtower Society Jehoiakim began his three years
servitude in his 8th year &quot;early in 620 B.C.E.&quot; [1, p. 1269] and then
rebelled at the end of the three years resulting in the siege of
Jerusalem in &quot;618 B.C.E.&quot; [1, p. 1267]. The Insight book also states
that it &quot;appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city&quot; (or
as shown above, he actually died just before it began).</p>
<p>When therefore would the multiple attacks of marauder bands have occured
if Jehoiakim's rebellion (at the end of three years servitude) is
immediately followed by his death and the accession of Jehoiachin?</p>
<h3 id="the-utensils-and-the-captives"><a class="header" href="#the-utensils-and-the-captives">The Utensils and the Captives</a></h3>
<p>Comparing the statements (NWT) regarding the loot taken from Jerusalem
it does not seem to be consistent to place Daniel 1:2 and 2 Chronicles
36:7 as the same event as the siege resulting in Jehoiachin's capture:</p>

<p>Against this argument the Watchtower states in the Kingdom Come book:</p>
<blockquote>

captive in his seventh year, his 18th year and his 23rd year, not his
accession year. [3, p. 188]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However it is already seen that Jeremiah does not contain a complete
count of the captives since it contradicts the number (and also year,
depending on interpretation) of captives described in 2 Kings 24:14
(3023 in the 7th year vs 10,000+ in the 8th year), so Jeremiah 52 surely
should not be treated as an exhaustive list of all captives taken by
Nebuchadnezzar. [1, p. 415]</p>
<h3 id="nebuchadnezzars-conquest-of-hattu"><a class="header" href="#nebuchadnezzars-conquest-of-hattu">Nebuchadnezzar's Conquest of Hattu</a></h3>
<p>The Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle <a href="../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> provides a detailed account of
Nebuchadnezzar's activities during his early years as king:</p>
<p>Accession Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The twenty-first year]: The king of Akkad stayed home (while)
Nebuchadnezzar (II), his eldest son (and) the crown prince, mustered
[the army of Akkad]. He took his army's lead and marched to
Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates. He crossed the river
[to encounter the army of Egypt] which was encamped at Carchemish.
[...] They did battle together. The army of Egypt retreated before
him. He inflicted a [defeat] upon them (and) finished them off
completely. In the district of Hamath the army of Akkad overtook the
remainder of the army of [Egypt which] managed to escape [from]
the defeat and which was not overcome. They (the army of Akkad)
inflicted a defeat upon them (so that) a single (Egyptian) man [did
not return] home. <strong>At that time Nebuchadnezzar (II) conquered all of
Ha[ma]th.</strong> For twenty-one years Nabopolassar ruled Babylon. <strong>In
(his) accession year Nebuchadnezzar (II) returned to Hattu. Until the
month Shebat he marched about victoriously in Hattu.</strong> In the month
Shebat <strong>he took the vast booty of Hattu</strong> to Babylon. In the month
Nisan he took the hand of Bel and the son of Bel (and) celebrated the
Akitu festival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first year of Nebuchadnezzar (II): In the month Sivan <strong>he
mustered his army and marched to Hattu. Until the month Kislev he
marched about victoriously in Hattu. All the kings of Hattu came into
his presence and he received their vast tribute.</strong> He marched to
Ashkelon and in the month Kislev he captured it, seized its king,
plundered [and sac]ked it. He turned the city into a ruin heap. In
the month Shebat he marched away and [returned] to Bab[ylon].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sec[ond year]: In the month Iyyar <strong>the king of Akkad
strengthened his large army and [marched to Hattu]</strong>. He encamped
[...] ... large siege towers he moved acr[oss ... ... from the
month] Iyyar until the month <strong>[... he marched about victoriously in
Hattu]</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Third Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The third year: In the month ..., on] the thirteenth [day]
Nabu-shumu-lishir [...] [In the month ... <strong>the king of Akka]d
mustered his army and [marched] to Hattu.</strong> [... ...] He brought
the vast [booty] of Hattu into Akkad. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth year: <strong>The king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to
Hattu. [He marched about victoriously] in Hattu.</strong> In the month
Kislev he took his army's lead and marched to Egypt. (When) the king
of Egypt heard (the news) he m[ustered] his army. They fought one
another in the battlefield and both sides suffered severe losses (lit.
they inflicted a major defeat upon one another). The king of Akkad and
his army turned and [went back] to Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fifth year: <strong>The king of Akkad stayed home</strong> (and) refitted his
numerous horses and chariotry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sixth Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sixth year: In the month Kislev <strong>the king of Akkad mustered his
army and marched to Hattu.</strong> He despatched his army from Hattu and
they went off to the desert. They plundered extensively the
possessions, animals, and gods of the numerous Arabs. In the month
Adar the king went home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seventh Year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seventh year: In the month Kislev <strong>the king of Akkad mustered his
army and marched to Hattu. He encamped against the city of Judah</strong> and
on the second day of the month Adar he captured the city (and) seized
(its) king. A king of his own choice he appointed in the city (and)
taking the <strong>vast tribute</strong> he brought it into Babylon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably in the 7th year the chronicle describes the siege of Jerusalem
where Jehoiachin is captured, and identifies it as being in the area of
&quot;Hattu&quot;. However from the chronicle we can also see that Nebuchadnezzar
also marched through Hattu in his accession, 1st-4th, and 6th years, and
even more significantly in the 1st year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the kings of Hattu came into his presence and he received their
<strong>vast tribute</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It therefore seems very unlikely that Jehoiakim did not become a vassal
of Nebuchadnezzar until his 8th year as dated by the Watchtower, instead
is it was likely to be sometime as early as the autumn of
Nebuchadnezzar's accession year (the 4th year of Jehoiakim).</p>
<p>Against this argument the Kingdom Come book says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Berossus claims that Nebuchadnezzar took Jewish captives in his
accession year, there are no cuneiform documents supporting this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the tributes described in the chronicles should be interpreted
as including captives, such as in 7th year where Nebuchadnezzar took
&quot;vast tribute&quot;, which we already know must have included captives (Jer
52:28, 2 Kings 24:14).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 'accession year' Nebuchadrezzar went back again to the Hatti
land and until the month of Sebat marched unopposed through the Hatti
land; in the month of Sebat he took the heavy tribute of the Hatti
territory to Babylon.<br><br> It is certain that this 'heavy tribute'
consisted not only of treasure but also of prisoners from the
conquered countries. To refrain from doing so would have been
altogether too alien from the customs of the kings of Babylon and
Assyria. [12]</p>
