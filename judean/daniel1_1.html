<p>As listed in the <a href="solutions/watchtower.html">Watchtower Judean Chronology</a>
table the Watchtower dates the Nebuchadnezzar's invasion of Judah as
described in 2 Kings 24:1 to sometime in the 8th year of Jehoiakim.</p>
<p>Unusually however the Watchtower then chooses to interpret the siege of
Jerusalem described in Daniel 1:1 and 2 Chronicles 36:6 as referring to
the later siege resulting in Jehoiachin's capture (2 Kings 24:10, which
was the 11th year of Jehoiakim), rather than the earlier invasion
resulting in Jehoiakim becoming a vassal for 3 years (2 Kings 24:1).</p>
<h3 id="insight-book"><a class="header" href="#insight-book">Insight Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Second Kings 24:1 shows that Nebuchadnezzar brought pressure upon the
Judean king “and so Jehoiakim became his servant [or vassal] for
three years. However, he [Jehoiakim] turned back and rebelled
against him [Nebuchadnezzar].” Evidently it is to this third year of
Jehoiakim as a vassal king under Babylon that Daniel refers at Daniel
1:1. It could not be Jehoiakim’s third year of his 11-year reign over
Judah, for at that time Jehoiakim was a vassal, not to Babylon, but to
Egypt’s Pharaoh Necho. It was not until Jehoiakim’s fourth year of
rule over Judah that Nebuchadnezzar demolished Egyptian domination
over Syria-Palestine by his victory at Carchemish (625 B.C.E.
[apparently after Nisan]). (Jer 46:2) Since Jehoiakim’s revolt
against Babylon led to his downfall after about 11 years on the
throne, the beginning of his three-year vassalage to Babylon must have
begun toward the end of his eighth year of rule, or early in 620
B.C.E.<br><br> Daniel’s account (1:1, 2) states that Nebuchadnezzar
came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and that Jehoiakim, along
with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s
hand. However, the account at 2 Kings 24:10-15 describes the siege of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son
Jehoiachin, whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the
one who finally capitulated and went out to the Babylonians. It
therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city,
perhaps in the early part thereof. Jehovah’s prophecy through Jeremiah
(22:18, 19; 36:30) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a
decent burial; his corpse was to lie unattended outside the gates of
Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by night.
Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’
(Da 1:2) is not revealed. It may have been in the sense of his dying
under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into
captivity, so that Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship
at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish
tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim
and commanded that his dead body be thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls.
(Jewish Antiquities, X, 97 [vi, 3]) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s
death came, it appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had
brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.—2Ch 36:6.
[1, p. 1269]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very little is known of his early life, but he [Daniel] tells of
being taken to Babylon, likely as a teenage prince, along with other
royal offspring and nobles. (Da 1:3-6) This was in Jehoiakim’s third
year (as tributary king to Babylon), which third year started in the
spring of 618 B.C.E. (Da 1:1) With Jehoiakim’s inglorious death,
Jehoiachin, his son, ruled for a few months before surrendering. Early
in 617 B.C.E., Jehoiachin and other “foremost men,” also young Daniel
(2Ki 24:15), were taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. [1, p.
576]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the age of 18 Jehoiachin became king and continued the bad
practices of his father. (2Ki 24:8, 9; 2Ch 36:9, ftn) Jehoiachin’s
father, Jehoiakim, had been under subjection to Babylonian King
Nebuchadnezzar but rebelled in his third year of such vassalage (618
B.C.E.). (2Ki 24:1) This resulted in a siege being laid against
Jerusalem. The expression “during that time” (2Ki 24:10) may refer,
not to Jehoiachin’s brief reign, but to the general period in which it
fits, hence allowing for the siege to have begun during his father
Jehoiakim’s reign, as Daniel 1:1, 2 seems to indicate. It appears that
Jehoiakim died during this siege and Jehoiachin ascended the throne of
Judah. His rule ended, however, a mere three months and ten days
later, when he surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E. (in the
month of Adar, according to a Babylonian chronicle). (2Ki 24:11, 12;
2Ch 36:9; Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, by A. Grayson, 1975, p.
102) In fulfillment of Jehovah’s word through Jeremiah, he was taken
into Babylonian exile. (Jer 22:24-27; 24:1; 27:19, 20; 29:1, 2) Other
members of the royal household, court officials, craftsmen, and
warriors were also exiled.—2Ki 24:14-16; [1, p. 1267]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="daniel-book"><a class="header" href="#daniel-book">Daniel Book</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel 1:1 reads: “In the third year of the kingship of Jehoiakim the
king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem
and proceeded to lay siege to it.” Critics have found fault with this
scripture because it does not seem to agree with Jeremiah, who says
that the fourth year of Jehoiakim was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar. (Jeremiah 25:1; 46:2) Was Daniel contradicting
Jeremiah? With more information, the matter is readily clarified. When
first made king in 628 B.C.E. by Pharaoh Necho, Jehoiakim became a
mere puppet of that Egyptian ruler. This was about three years before
Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father to the throne of Babylon, in 624
B.C.E. Soon thereafter (in 620 B.C.E.), Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah
and made Jehoiakim a vassal king under Babylon. (2 Kings 23:34; 24:1)
To a Jew living in Babylon, Jehoiakim’s “third year” would have been
the third year of that king’s vassal service to Babylon. Daniel wrote
from that perspective. Jeremiah, however, wrote from the perspective
of the Jews living right in Jerusalem. So he referred to Jehoiakim’s
kingship as starting when Pharaoh Necho made him king. [2, p. 18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 625 B.C.E., Egyptian Pharaoh Necho... led his army to Carchemish...
The Babylonian army, led by Crown Prince Nebuchadnezzar, inflicted a
devastating blow on Pharaoh Necho’s forces. (Jeremiah 46:2) Riding on
the momentum of his victory, Nebuchadnezzar swept over Syria and
Palestine and, for all practical purposes, put an end to Egyptian
domination in this region. It was only the death of his father,
Nabopolassar, that brought a temporary halt to his campaign.<br><br>
The next year, Nebuchadnezzar—now enthroned as king of Babylon—once
again turned his attention to his military campaigns in Syria and
Palestine. It was during this period that he came to Jerusalem for the
first time. The Bible reports: “In his days Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon came up, and so Jehoiakim became his servant for three years.
However, he turned back and rebelled against him.”—2 Kings 24:1. [2,
p. 31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote would actually appear to contradict the Insight book page on
Jehoiakim above - it seems to be stating that Jehoiakim became
Nebuchadnezzar's &quot;servant for three years&quot; starting in the year after
the battle of Carchemish; around 624 B.C.E - the 1st year of
Nebuchadnezzar which was the 5th year of Jehoiakim. Whereas the Insight
book states it was in the 8th year of Jehoiakim &quot;or early in 620
B.C.E.&quot;.</p>

<p>As acknowledged in the Insight book [3, p. 480], <a href="../orthodox/chronicles/bm21946.html">BM
21946</a> states that
<code>In the month Kislev [IX] the king of Akkad mustered his army and marched to Hattu</code>,
and then that
<code>on the second day of the month Adar [XII] he captured the city (and) seized (its) king.</code></p>
<p>According to 2 Chronicles 36:9 and 2 Kings 24:8, Jehoiachin reigned in
Jerusalem for 3 months and 10 days, subtracting this from the end of his
rule on 2/XII, his rule must have began (and Jehoiakim must have died)
around the end of month VIII, which would be before Nebuchadnezzar
marched to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>How can Daniel 1:2 where &quot;Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his
hand&quot; (NWT) and 2 Chronicles 36:6 where &quot;Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against him [Jehoiakim] in order to bind him with two copper
fetters to take him off to Babylon&quot; (NWT) make sense in this context
given that Jehoiakim had already died before Nebuchadnezzar marched
against the city?</p>
<p>According to Clines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some kind of an attack upon Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim is
demanded by the evidence of 2 Chr. 36:6f., which recounts that
Nebuchadrezzar took Jehoiakim in fetters to BabyIon, and also carried
off some of the temple vessels. This cannot have happened at the time
of the siege of Jerusalem in early 597 B.C., since Jehoiakim died on
December 7, 598, just before the Babylonian troops set out for
Jerusalem. So if the Biblical Chronicles tradition is sound, it is
reasonable to suppose that at some time during his reign 'Jehoiakim
took part of the temple treasure [to Babylon] as a <em>qatrē</em>-offering
or as <em>biltu</em> ('tribute') to buy off the Babylonians'. 2 Kings 24:1,
'Nebuchadnezzar came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three
years', may in turn be related to the same circumstances. [4, p. 21]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast the siege in the first year of Jehoiachin in 2 Kings 24 is
described in an order consistent with the Babylonian account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6</strong> Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers...<br>
<strong>8</strong> Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned
for three months in Jerusalem... <strong>9</strong> He continued to do what was bad
in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that his father had done. <strong>10</strong>
During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came
up against Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. (2 Kings
24:6,8-10, NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="marauder-bands"><a class="header" href="#marauder-bands">Marauder Bands</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1</strong> In Jehoiakim’s days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against
him, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. However, he
turned against him and rebelled. <strong>2</strong> Then Jehovah began to send
against him marauder bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and
Ammonites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it...<br>
<strong>6</strong> Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers and his son
Jehoiachin became king in his place. (2 Kings 24:1,2,6,10 NWT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Watchtower Society Jehoiakim began his three years
servitude in his 8th year &quot;early in 620 B.C.E.&quot; [1, p. 1269] and then
rebelled at the end of the three years resulting in the siege of
Jerusalem in &quot;618 B.C.E.&quot; [1, p. 1267]. The Insight book also states
that it &quot;appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city&quot; (or
as shown above, he actually died just before it began).</p>
<p>When therefore would the multiple attacks of marauder bands have occured
if Jehoiakim's rebellion (at the end of three years servitude) is
immediately followed by his death and the accession of Jehoiachin?</p>

<p>Comparing the statements (NWT) regarding the loot taken from Jerusalem
it does not seem to be consistent to place Daniel 1:2 and 2 Chronicles
36:7 as the same event as the siege resulting in Jehoiachin's capture:</p>
