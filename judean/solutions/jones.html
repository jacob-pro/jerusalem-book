<blockquote>
<p>Thiele placed the Josiah-Neco confrontation in the 17th year of
Nabopolassar (609 BC). But then he added that Josiah perished in the
month of Tammuz (June–July) as Chronicles 3:66–67 gives that month as
the beginning of the Assyrian-Egyptian counterattack against Haran.2
This decision resulted in his placing the three-month reign of
Jehoahaz (2 Kings 23:31) from Tammuz (June–July) to sometime in
September or October, yet neither is correct.<br><br> Thiele failed to
consider logistics. It could have easily taken as much as several
months for Neco to regroup and rest his troops after the Battle of
Megiddo, then march his massive army some 425± miles over often rugged
to mountainous terrain in order to join with the Assyrian’s under
Ashur-uballit II. After again resting his soldiers (they must be fit
to fight man-to-man with swords, spears and bows), the two kings must
lay out battle plans, recross the Euphrates River, march their immense
joint forces some 70 miles to Haran, and finally launch the attack.
Thus, Josiah could hardly have been killed in the month of Tammuz.
Accordingly, he was slain months earlier.<br><br> Moreover, charting
the data quickly clarifies the matter (see next page and Chart 5c).
From this, it will be seen that Josiah had to have died near mid-March
(Adar) but shortly before Nisan 1 of 609 BC (Tuesday, March 20th,
Gregorian). [2, p. 188]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, it will be observed that the fourth year of Jehoiakim is placed
in the year of the Battle of Carchemish (605 BC) in agreement with
Jer. 46:2. However, Jer. 25:1 also speaks of the fourth year of
Jehoiakim saying: “that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon” (see diagram on page 126). How may this apparent discrepancy
be reconciled?<br><br> The Hebrew words for “first year” in Jer. 25:1
are השנה הראשנית (hashshanah haroshniyth). Not being found elsewhere
in Scripture, the phrase is unique and the feminine singular form of
the adjective modifying the word “year” can mean either “first or
beginning”. Thus the phrase in Jer. 25:1 is seen as not referring to
Nebuchadnezzar’s official first year but to his initial year on the
throne, the year of his accession. [2, p. 125]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones places Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Judah in the 3rd year of
Jehoiakim as stated in Daniel 1:1, which would actually be in the year
prior to Nebuchadnezzar's accession. He believes this is necessary to
fit 3 years of Daniel's training (Daniel 1:5):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in resolving this issue revolves around the fact that
it simply would not be possible that Daniel and his three friends
could be so highly elevated in the affairs of the government of
Babylonia in chapter 2 (Dan. 2:48, 49) and afterward still have to
appear before King Nebuchadnezzar to obtain his approval by proving
their abilities “to stand in the king’s palace” (Dan. 1:4, 18–20) as
though they were yet mere students. But such would be the case were
the happenings of chapter 2 imbedded somewhere within the three-year
time frame of chapter 1. Accordingly, the context of chapter 2 clearly
follows <em>after</em> chapter 1 chronologically. Since chapter 1 encompasses
most of a three year span (cp. vv. 4, 5, 18), then the events in
chapter 2 must have occurred after Daniel’s schooling. Thus, the
second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign must take place after Daniel’s
and the other princes of Judah’s “graduation”. [2, p. 189]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It follows then that Daniel 1:1 does not conflict with Jeremiah 25:1
as is often claimed. Observe that Daniel 1:1 does not say that the
third year of the reign of Jehoiakim is the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. As illustrated, such would be impossible from
the data in chapter 1 when compared to 2:1 which is said to occur in
Nebuchadnezzar’s second year of dominion. Moreover, Daniel 1:1 is
merely a statement of identification, i.e., the Nebuchadnezzar who
came and besieged Jerusalem in Jehoiakim’s third year is the same man
who ascended to the throne and became sole rex the following year
(Jer. 25:1). The apparent contradiction has been resolved by simply
allowing the Scriptures to speak for themselves, apart from profane
materials. [2, p. 190]</p>

<h4 id="criticism"><a class="header" href="#criticism">Criticism</a></h4>
<p>Against Jones' dating for Daniel 1:1 Ian Foley argues [3, p. 31]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jones (2004, 189) takes the view that the only possible solution to
this first problem is that Nebuchadnezzar must have besieged Jerusalem
and Daniel must have been exiled in 606 BC. However, this solution
creates as many problems as it solves because (1) Nebuchadnezzar was
not yet king in 606 BC. (However, he was crown prince, and perhaps the
title of &quot;king&quot; could be used), (2) Jones uses nonaccession year
reckoning for the regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar so that his second
year is 604 BC, and it is not clear why he did not use accession year
reckoning to make Nebuchadnezzar's second year 603 BC. (3) Until the
defeat of the Egyptians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, there
is strong evidence that Egypt controlled Judah and Palestine and that
Nebuchadnezzar's expeditions prior to that involved conflict with
Egypt in Syria and further north, and (4) there are other solutions to
the two problems that would satisfy Jones's view of biblical
inspiration without the need to propose Daniel's exile in 606 BC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the Hebrew account seems to conflict with the Babylonian
record. It declares that the second deportation which brought
Jehoiachin to Babylon, whereupon Zedekiah was placed on the throne in
Jerusalem, occurred in the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar.<br><br> The
“discrepancy” resolves itself when it is seen that the Babylonian
account has Jerusalem falling into their hands on 2 Adar.2 Now Adar is
the 12th and final month of the 7th year. It naturally follows that
selecting a vassal, establishing a new government, cutting in pieces
the gold vessels in the Temple (2 Kings 24:13) and preparing the vast
booty for transport before returning to Babylon requires time.
Moreover, 2 Kings 24:14–16 tells us that the populace was divided and
all the leaders, the most affluent, the surviving warriors of valor,
masons, smiths, and carpenters – at least 10,000 of the cream of
Judah’s citizenry – were separated from the poorest of the common
people and then carried away to the Chaldean homeland. Such an
undertaking would also have required time. <br><br> Indeed, the Hebrew
Text reveals the precise length of that interval! In 2 Chron. 36:9–10
we learn that, after a reign of three months and ten days, “when the
year was expired” Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) was brought to Babylon. Hence,
this very brief but undefined time after 1 Nisan of the next year
would fall in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar [2, p. 126]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the deportations at the end of Jeremiah, in the 7th and 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, inconceivably, the later portion of Jeremiah 52 seems to record
the fall of Jerusalem as having taken place in the 18th year of
Nebuchadnezzar rather than in his 19th (which was Zedekiah’s 11th). To
begin with, these verses are not recorded in 2 Kings 25. Jeremiah
52:28–34 seems to be an addendum – possibly written by Ezra in Babylon
after Jeremiah’s death (It is noteworthy that it is not part of the
text of the LXX.).<br><br> Being so small a number, most suppose
verses 28–30 are referring to only the adult males of importance. Yet,
how can we conclude that only 4,600 Jews were carried away in all of
Nebuchadnezzar’s expeditions when we know at least 10,000 of
prominence were carried away at one time with Jeconiah in 597 BC (2
Kings 24:12–16)?<br><br> Indeed, the very fact that 2 Kings 24:12–16
records the removal of these 10,000 in the eighth year of
Nebuchadnezzar demands that Jer. 52:28 where 3,023 were said to have
been carried away in that monarch’s seventh year is referring to a
completely separate event. The differing numbers should alert us that
it is not merely a matter of attempting to reconcile Nebuchadnezzar’s
seventh with his eighth year by “Hebrew reckoning” or “Babylonian
reckoning” that is in view here. Two different happenings are before
us.<br><br> It follows that if these are not equivalent, and thus
should not be associated, then the same is true for trying to force
the “18th year” of Jer. 52:29 to match the “19th year” of Jer. 52:12
and 2 Kings 25:8. Hence, it seems most reasonable to conclude with
Ussher that there were three significant deportations – in 606 BC
(when Nebuchadnezzar was general-of-the-army and crown prince,
Dan.1:1), as well as his 8th, and 19th regnal years — which are to be
distinguished from the minor ones that Jer. 52:28–30 lists in his 7th,
18th, and 23rd years. These latter, then, were likely added after the
fact to complete the historical record.<br><br> If so, the first minor
deportation, reported by Jeremiah to have transpired in
Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year, would have been those seized by the bands
of Chaldeans, Syrians, etc. whom the king of Babylon sent against
Judah prior to his coming (2 Kings 24:2). That in the 18th year would
correspond to when the Chaldeans broke off the siege of Jerusalem to
meet Pharaoh’s approaching army. Afterward, it may have been deemed
prudent to march the swelling number of Egyptian and Jewish prisoners
in the camp off to Babylon. [2, p. 127]</p>

<h3 id="release-of-jehoiachin"><a class="header" href="#release-of-jehoiachin">Release of Jehoiachin</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, in the first year of his reign, Evil Merodach (Amel-Marduk),
Nebuchadnezzar’s son and successor, liberated Jehoiachin from prison
and raised him to a position of honor at the palace (562 BC, the 18th
Jubilee — Jer. 52:31–34). Evil Merodach’s kind, respectful treatment
of Jehoiachin after 37 years’ imprisonment further substantiates the
correctness of the above assertions. [2, p. 128]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones appears to be counting 37 years on the Anno Mundi (Year After
Creation) calendar which begins its new year in Tishri.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resulted in fixing the year of “the captivity” as AM 3407. The
relevant Scriptures relating to the reigns of the kings of Judah were
then charted in terms of AM years. This resulted in fixing the year of
“the captivity” as AM 3407. Inclusively numbering 37 years from this
first year of Jeconiah’s (Jehoiachin) captivity brought me to 3443 AM,
the first year of the reign of Evil-merodach, son and successor of
Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 25:27, cp. 2 Kings 24:12, 15). Counting back
from 3443 AM, 3418 was found to be Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year – the
very year the Scriptures say he razed Jerusalem (Jer. 52:12–15). As
stated above, this destruction took place in Zedekiah’s 11th year (2
Kings 25:1–7), thus confirming the synchronization of Judah and
Babylon in 3418. [2, p. 309]</p>
