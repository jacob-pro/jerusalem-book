<p>John Phillip Hyatt (1909-1972) was an Old Testament professor [1].</p>
<p>The key assumptions of his chronology include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kings uses a system which reckons the accession year as the first year
of a king’s reign, whereas Jer 52 employs the Babylonian system which
does not count the accession year, but reckons as the first year of a
king the year beginning with his formal coronation in Nisan following
his accession. [2, p. 278]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to determine certainly whether the
Judeans at this period counted year 1 of a new king from Tishri 1 (in
the fall) or Nisan 1 (in the spring)…<br> All in all, however, I am
inclined to think that at the time of Jehoiakim’s accession the regnal
year began in Nisan. [3, p. 209]</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-megiddo"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-megiddo">Battle of Megiddo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the month Du’uzu of the seventeenth year of Nabopolassar, which
corresponds to June 25—July 23 of 609 B. C., the city of Harran was
attacked by Ashur-uballit, king of Assyria, and “a large Egyptian
army.” This city had been conquered by the Babylonians in the previous
year, when the Egyptians may have been present in Syria. The course of
events is difficult to reconstruct because of the lacunae in the
cuneiform text, but it appears that the Assyro-Egyptian forces
directed their main assault upon the garrison which had been stationed
in Harran by the Babylonians, and that they were at first successful,
but could not decisively defeat the defenders. They thereupon laid
seige (sic) to the city for about two months, until the month Ululu
(Aug. 23—Sep. 20). When Nabopolassar approached with his army, the
attackers retired, apparently without meeting Nabopolassar in battle.
The Egyptians returned to their own land, and nothing more is heard of
Ashur-uballit. <br><br> The death of Josiah must be understood in
connection with these events. He had pursued a successful
anti-Assyrian policy for many years, and must have been aware that
Egypt was in alliance with the Assyrians. He could not afford to see
the Egyptians advance to the aid of Ashur-uballit, and so went out to
meet Pharaoh Neco on his way to Syria. The laconic account of the
biblical historian in 2 Kings xxiii 29 is simply, “and Pharaoh Neco
slew him at Megiddo when he saw him.” This encounter must have taken
place before the attack on Harran by the Assyro-Egyptian forces. Since
it was customary for Near Eastern kings to mount their campaigns in
the spring, and since Neco needed time to make his junction with the
Assyrian forces and prepare for the attack on Harran, we must place
the death of Josiah no later than May, 609, and possibly
earlier.<br><br> On the death of Josiah, his son Jehoahaz was placed
on the throne by “the people of the land,” and ruled for three months.
At the end of that time he was deposed by Neco, who replaced him with
his brother Jehoiakim. The three months of Jehoiakim’s (sic) reign
must coincide with the time consumed by Neco in his march from Megiddo
to Harran and a part of the attack on that city. 2 Kings xxiii 33-34
says that it was in Riblah in the land of Hamath that Neco put
Jehoahaz in bonds, and laid a large tribute on Judah. He then made
Jehoiakim king of Judah and took Jehoahaz with him, eventually to
Egypt. These events ought to be dated soon after the initial success
at Harran while the Pharaoh was still in Syria, not after the approach
of the Babylonian army of Nabopolassar.10 Such actions by the Egyptian
king would hardly have been possible at the latter time. Hence, we
should date the dethronement of Jehoahaz and the accession of
Jehoiakim in July or early August, 609. [3, p. 207]</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-carchemish"><a class="header" href="#battle-of-carchemish">Battle of Carchemish</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The new documents confirm the fact that there was a battle of
Carchemish in 605 in which the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians.
This battle is mentioned in Jer 46:2 and by Josephus (<em>Ant. Jud.</em> X.
vi. 1; <em>Contra Apionem</em> I. 19), and the excavation of Carchemish
indicated that the city had been taken around 600. B. M. 21946, obv.
11. 1-8 gives a rather full account of the conflict. The date was
between April and August 605; Wiseman suggests probably May-June.
Nebuchadrezzar, the crown prince and eldest son of Nabopolassar, was
in command of the Babylonian army; his father evidently had remained
at home because of illness, for he died on 8 Ab (August 16, 605). The
record claims a complete defeat of the Egyptian army “into
nothingness” (<em>adi la bašē</em>). It also claims that at that time
Nebuchadrezzar conquered the whole of Hatti (<em>ana pāṭ gimrišu ikšud</em>).
Though it is clear that the battle of Carchemish was somewhat
decisive, the Egyptians still had considerable strength, and
Nebuchadrezzar had to make repeated invasions of Hatti (a general term
for Syria-Palestine) in order to maintain his control there. <br><br>
Nebuchadrezzar’s father died soon after the battle of Carchemish, and
the crown prince rushed to Babylon to take over the throne on 1 Elul
(September 7, 605). However, he was soon back in Hatti; the new
account says that he marched unopposed in Hatti until Shebat (February
604). Then he “took the heavy tribute of Hatti to Babylon” (Obv. 1.
13). Two months later he was in Babylon to observe the <em>akitu</em>
festival and take the hands of Bel and the son of Bel, apparently
signalizing his enthronement. [2, p. 279]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was probably in 605, or in the following year, that Jehoiakim
submitted to the Babylonian king, as recorded in II Kings 24:1; II
Chron 36:6 is probably a reminiscence of the submission, with some
exaggeration. Josephus indicates that after the battle of Carchemish
Nebuchadrezzar took all of Syria, as far as Pelusium, except Judah
(<em>Ant. Jud.</em> X. vi. 1); and II Kings 24:7 says that “the king of
Babylon took all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of
Egypt to the River Euphrates.”<br><br> Nebuchadrezzar probably did
receive the submission of some of the western states at this time, but
the new texts indicate that he had to make campaigns into Hatti in
nearly every subsequent year in order to enforce the payment of
tribute and keep control. In his first year he marched to Hatti in
Sivan (June 604). We are told that “all the kings of Hatti came before
him, and he received their heavy tribute” (Obv. 1. 17). The next line
tells of his capturing and destroying a city; Wiseman reads it as
Ashkelon (<em><sup>al</sup>iš-qi-il-lu-nu</em>), but indicates that the first
two signs are uncertain, being written over an erasure. It is by no
means improbable that the Babylonian king had to fight against that
city (see below).<br><br> In his 3rd and 4th years Nebuchadrezzar was
back in Hatti. In the latter year he came into direct conflict with
the Egyptian army. After telling of his marching unopposed in Hatti,
the chronicle goes on to say: “In the month Kislev [beginning
November 20, 601] he took the lead of his army and marched to Egypt.
The king of Egypt heard, and mustered his army. In open battle they
smote the breast of each other and inflicted great destruction upon
each other. The king of Akkad and his army turned around, and went
back to Babylon” (Rev. 11. 6-7). The laconic account of the next year
is that the king of Akkad remained at home “and gathered together his
chariots and horses in great numbers” (Rev. 1. 8). The outcome of this
battle must have been defeat for the Babylonian army, or at best a
draw. This battle must lie back of Jehoiakim’s change of allegiance,
when he withheld tribute from Babylonia, probably making an alliance
with Egypt. II Kings 24:1 says that this occurred three years after
Jehoiakim became the servant of Nebuchadrezzar; three full years after
the submission of Jehoiakim in either 605 or 604 would bring us to
this date. It is impossible to tell whether Jehoiakim’s change of
allegiance brought on the invasion by Nebuchadrezzar, or whether
Jehoiakim rebelled after he saw the success of Egypt. The latter seems
more logical. The Kings account goes on to say that Yahweh sent
against Jehoiakim “bands” (גדודי) of Chaldeans, Syrians (or
Edomites?), Moabites, and Ammonites (24:2). This apparently means that
Nebuchadrezzar attempted to punish Jehoiakim by means of marauding
bands of his own men and some drawn from the western states under his
control. The destruction could not have been thorough; Jer
9:10-11,17-22, 12:7-13 may reflect some devastation in Judah at this
time. In his 6th year (599/8), after replenishing his army,
Nebuchadrezzar marched again to Hatti. This time he scoured the desert
to the east of Syria-Palestine and “took much plunder from the Arabs,
their possessions, animals, and gods” (Rev. 1. 10). He returned to his
own land in Adar (February-March 598), and it was at the end of the
same year (December) that he started the invasion that led to the
capture of Jerusalem. [2, p. 280]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hyatt doesn’t appear to directly explain how he believes this fits in
with Daniel 1:1, but he is placing the subjugation of Judah in the 4th
or 5th years of Jehoiakim, rather than the 3rd as specified in Daniel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The date, 2 Adar of Nebuchadrezzar’s 7th year (March 16, 597) is not
contrary to the biblical accounts. II Kings 24:12 gives the date as
the 8th year of Nebuchadrezzar, whereas Jer 52:28 has the 7th year. It
is obvious that Kings uses a system which reckons the accession year
as the first year of a king’s reign, whereas Jer 52 employs the
Babylonian system which does not count the accession year, but reckons
as the first year of a king the year beginning with his formal
coronation in Nisan following his accession…<br><br> The new document
does not name any of the Judean kings, but it is obvious that the
captured king was Jehoiachin, and the king whom Nebuchadrezzar placed
on the throne was Zedekiah. According to the clear statement of the
text, Nebuchadrezzar mustered his army in Kislev (which began December
17, 598), and took Jerusalem on March 16, only three months later. If
we allow approximately a month for the march to Jerusalem and the
beginning of the siege, the siege itself could not have lasted much
more than two months, possibly less. According to II Kings 24:8
Jehoiachin had a reign of three months, while II Chron 36:9 gives him
three months and ten days. From these data, it would appear that
Jehoiakim died before the beginning of the siege. [2, p. 278]</p>

number of exiles between Jeremiah 52 and 2 Kings 24-25.</p>
